# Worker Deploy & Graceful Shutdown Report — 2025-10-07

## Summary
- **Status**: ✅ Healthy — graceful shutdown worked; new worker took over without errors.
- **Queue**: `orchestrator` (RQ)
- **Key Behaviors**:
  - Heartbeat thread started, state tracked, and cleaned on shutdown
  - RQ registries cleaned; jobs acknowledged (`Job OK`)
  - No exceptions/tracebacks observed
- **Warnings**: `DeprecationWarning: datetime.utcnow()` → fixed in PR #163 (timezone-aware)
- **Links**:
  - **e2e**: https://github.com/RC918/morningai/actions/runs/18317771788
  - **Sentry smoke**: https://github.com/RC918/morningai/actions/runs/18317030222
  - **Release**: v9.3.0

## Timeline (UTC)
| Time (UTC) | Event |
|---|---|
| 16:01:05 | Deploy started |
| 16:02:34 | Render: service live |
| 16:02:41 | Worker starting; heartbeat thread started; monitoring enabled |
| 16:02:42 | Listening on `orchestrator`; registries cleaned |
| ~16:03:35 | **Graceful shutdown**: state → `shutting_down`, heartbeat stopped & key cleaned, shutdown complete |
| 16:07:36 | New orchestrator task started |
| 16:07:43 | `Job OK`; result kept 86400s |

> Note: saw duplicate “Initiating graceful shutdown” blocks (likely rolling restart old/new pods).  
> PR #163 adds **idempotent shutdown guard** to avoid duplicate logs.

## Findings
- **Graceful shutdown** behaved as designed: stop pulling new jobs, finish in-flight job, update heartbeat, clean key, exit.
- **RQ lifecycle** normal: registries cleaned; `Job OK` confirms worker processed task successfully.
- **No error stacktraces** in the interval.
- **Deprecation warnings** resolved by PR #163 (`datetime.now(datetime.UTC)`).

## Next actions
- (Done) Merge PR #163 — timezone-aware + idempotent shutdown.
- (Optional) Add Sentry breadcrumb for `shutting_down` transition to correlate restarts.
- (Optional) Alert if `worker:heartbeat:*` missing > 2 min during deploy window.
