# RLS Security Fix - Migration 015

**Date**: 2025-10-23  
**Migration**: 015_restrict_rls_anon_access.sql  
**Status**: ✅ **CRITICAL SECURITY FIX**  
**Related PRs**: #626 (testing), #618 (original RLS implementation)

---

## Executive Summary

**Problem**: Migration 014 inadvertently granted public read access to sensitive operational and business data via the anon key.

**Solution**: Migration 015 restricts anon key access to only public content (FAQs), while requiring real user authentication for sensitive tables.

**Impact**: 
- ✅ Protects LLM cost data from competitors
- ✅ Hides system alerts from potential attackers  
- ✅ Secures user search history (GDPR compliance)
- ✅ Restricts agent reputation data
- ✅ Maintains public FAQ access (by design)

---

## Background

### The Problem

Migration 014 created RLS policies with `TO authenticated`, intending to provide Dashboard users with read access. However, in Supabase:

- `anon` role is part of the `authenticated` group
- `TO authenticated` policies **include anon role**
- Therefore, anon key could read all 9 tables

This was discovered during comprehensive RLS testing (PR #626).

### Security Risks Identified

**P0 - Critical (Security & Privacy)**:
1. `trace_metrics` - LLM costs, usage patterns, error messages
2. `alerts` - System health, vulnerabilities, attack indicators  
3. `faq_search_history` - User privacy data (GDPR violation)

**P1 - High (Business Intelligence)**:
4. `agent_reputation` - AI system maturity indicators
5. `reputation_events` - Complete agent behavior audit trail

**P2 - Medium (Data Protection)**:
6. `embeddings` - Vector data with potentially sensitive metadata
7. `vector_queries` - Search patterns and AI behavior

**P3 - Low (Designed for Public)**:
8. `faqs` - Public content ✅
9. `faq_categories` - Public metadata ✅

---

## Solution: Migration 015

### Approach

**Option A: Strict Security** (Implemented)
- Remove anon key access from 7 sensitive tables
- Require real user authentication (`auth.uid() IS NOT NULL`)
- Keep FAQs public (by design)

### Technical Implementation

```sql
-- Step 1: Remove overly permissive policies
DROP POLICY "authenticated_trace_metrics_read" ON trace_metrics;
-- (repeat for all 7 sensitive tables)

-- Step 2: Create restricted policies
CREATE POLICY "user_authenticated_trace_metrics_read" ON trace_metrics
    FOR SELECT
    TO authenticated
    USING (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL);  -- Only real users, not anon key
```

### Security Model (After Fix)

| Role | Access Level | Tables |
|------|-------------|--------|
| `service_role` | Full (CRUD) | All 9 tables |
| Authenticated users | Read-only | All 9 tables |
| `anon` key | Read-only | FAQs only (2 tables) |
| Anonymous (no key) | Blocked | All tables |

---

## Testing

### Updated Test Structure

**Before Migration 015**:
```python
# All tables accessible via anon key (WRONG)
TABLES_WITH_RLS = [
    'faqs', 'faq_search_history', 'faq_categories',
    'embeddings', 'vector_queries', 'trace_metrics',
    'alerts', 'agent_reputation', 'reputation_events'
]
```

**After Migration 015**:
```python
# Split into public vs authenticated-only
TABLES_PUBLIC_ANON = ['faqs', 'faq_categories']
TABLES_AUTHENTICATED_ONLY = [
    'faq_search_history', 'embeddings', 'vector_queries',
    'trace_metrics', 'alerts', 'agent_reputation', 'reputation_events'
]
```

### Test Coverage

**New Test Classes**:
1. `TestAnonRolePublicAccess` - Verify anon key can access FAQs
2. `TestAnonRoleBlockedFromSensitive` - Verify anon key blocked from sensitive tables
3. Updated `TestAuthenticatedRoleAccess` - Still works for all tables

**Expected Results**:
```bash
# Anon key should succeed
curl -H "apikey: $SUPABASE_ANON_KEY" "$SUPABASE_URL/rest/v1/faqs?limit=1"
# → 200 OK

# Anon key should be blocked  
curl -H "apikey: $SUPABASE_ANON_KEY" "$SUPABASE_URL/rest/v1/trace_metrics?limit=1"
# → 401 or 403

# Service role should still work
curl -H "apikey: $SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY" \
     "$SUPABASE_URL/rest/v1/trace_metrics?limit=1"
# → 200 OK
```

## Dashboard Impact

### Authentication Requirements

**Before Migration 015**:
- Dashboard could use anon key for all data
- No real user authentication required

**After Migration 015**:
- Dashboard needs real user authentication for sensitive data
- FAQs still accessible via anon key
- Service role maintains full access

### Implementation Notes

**If Dashboard uses anon key only**:
- ⚠️ Dashboard will show 401/403 errors for sensitive tables
- ✅ FAQs will continue to work
- 🔧 **Action Required**: Implement user authentication

**If Dashboard has user authentication**:
- ✅ All functionality preserved
- ✅ Users see all data after login
- ✅ No changes required

## Deployment Instructions

### Pre-Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Verify Dashboard authentication status
- [ ] Backup current RLS policies (if needed)
- [ ] Prepare rollback plan
- [ ] Schedule maintenance window (optional)

### Deployment Steps

1. **Execute Migration**:
   ```sql
   -- In Supabase SQL Editor or via CLI
   \i migrations/015_restrict_rls_anon_access.sql
   ```

2. **Verify Migration**:
   ```bash
   # Check migration completed successfully
   # Look for "Migration 015: COMPLETE ✅" message
   ```

3. **Test Access Patterns**:
   ```bash
   # Test anon key (should work for FAQs only)
   curl -H "apikey: $SUPABASE_ANON_KEY" "$SUPABASE_URL/rest/v1/faqs?limit=1"
   
   # Test anon key blocked (should fail)
   curl -H "apikey: $SUPABASE_ANON_KEY" "$SUPABASE_URL/rest/v1/trace_metrics?limit=1"
   
   # Test service role (should work)
   curl -H "apikey: $SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY" \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer $SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY" \
        "$SUPABASE_URL/rest/v1/trace_metrics?limit=1"
   ```

4. **Test Dashboard**:
   - [ ] Login to Dashboard
   - [ ] Verify all data loads correctly
   - [ ] Check for 401/403 errors
   - [ ] Confirm FAQs still public

5. **Run RLS Tests**:
   ```bash
   pytest tests/test_rls_policies_comprehensive.py -v
   ```

### Post-Deployment Verification

**Success Indicators**:
- ✅ Migration verification message appears
- ✅ Anon key blocked from sensitive tables (401/403)
- ✅ Anon key can still access FAQs (200)
- ✅ Service role maintains full access
- ✅ Dashboard works with authenticated users
- ✅ RLS tests pass

**Failure Indicators**:
- ❌ Migration fails with errors
- ❌ Anon key still accesses sensitive tables
- ❌ Service role loses access
- ❌ Dashboard shows 401 errors for authenticated users
- ❌ RLS tests fail

---

## Rollback Plan

### When to Rollback

**Immediate Rollback Required**:
- Migration fails to complete
- Service role loses access to any table
- Dashboard completely broken for authenticated users

**Consider Rollback**:
- Dashboard partially broken (can be fixed with authentication)
- Some RLS tests fail (may be test issues)

### Rollback Procedure

```sql
-- Rollback Migration 015
BEGIN;

-- Remove restricted policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "user_authenticated_trace_metrics_read" ON trace_metrics;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "user_authenticated_alerts_read" ON alerts;
-- (repeat for all 7 tables)

-- Restore original permissive policies
CREATE POLICY "authenticated_trace_metrics_read" ON trace_metrics
    FOR SELECT TO authenticated USING (true);
CREATE POLICY "authenticated_alerts_read" ON alerts
    FOR SELECT TO authenticated USING (true);
-- (repeat for all 7 tables)

COMMIT;
```

**⚠️ Warning**: Rollback re-exposes sensitive data to public access via anon key.
