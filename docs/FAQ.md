# System Architecture of MorningAI

MorningAI is designed as a robust, scalable, multi-tenant SaaS platform that leverages a combination of cutting-edge technologies and architectural patterns to deliver a wide range of features including autonomous agent system for code generation, FAQ generation, documentation management, and multi-platform integration. Below is an in-depth overview of its system architecture.

## Overview

MorningAI's architecture is built to support high concurrency, rapid scaling, and integration flexibility. It uses a microservices-oriented design pattern, with each service handling a specific piece of functionality. This approach allows for independent scaling and development of each component.

### Frontend

- **Technology Stack**: The frontend is built with React, utilizing Vite for fast builds and TailwindCSS for styling.
- **Path**: The frontend codebase can be found under `frontend/` in the RC918/morningai repository.
- **Functionality**: Provides the user interface for interacting with MorningAI's features. It communicates with the backend through RESTful APIs or WebSocket connections for real-time updates.

### Backend

- **Technology Stack**: Python with Flask framework serves as the core language and framework for backend services. Gunicorn is used as the WSGI HTTP server with multi-worker support to handle concurrent requests efficiently.
- **Path**: Backend services are located under `backend/`.
- **Components**:
  - **API Server**: Handles HTTP requests from the frontend, processes them, and responds accordingly.
  - **Worker Services**: Use Redis Queue (RQ) for task queuing and processing background jobs like code generation or FAQ updates.
  - **Orchestration Service**: Manages task workflows using LangGraph to ensure tasks are executed in the correct order and dependencies are resolved.

### Database

- **Technology Stack**: PostgreSQL hosted on Supabase, which provides additional features like Row Level Security (RLS) for data protection.
- **Integration Points**:
  - All backend services interact with the database through Supabase's client libraries or direct SQL queries.
  - Vector memory storage needs for AI models are handled by pgvector within PostgreSQL.

### AI Component

- **Technology Stack**: OpenAI GPT-4 powers the autonomous agent system and content generation tasks.
- **Integration Method**: Backend services communicate with OpenAI's API to send prompts and receive generated content.

### Multi-platform Integration

MorningAI integrates with various messaging platforms such as Telegram, LINE, and Messenger via their respective APIs. This enables MorningAI to interact with users across different platforms seamlessly.

### Deployment and CI/CD

- Hosted on Render.com, MorningAI benefits from continuous integration and deployment pipelines that ensure smooth rollouts of new features and fixes.
- CI/CD workflows are defined within `.render.yaml` file at the root of the repository.

## Code Examples

Due to the breadth of MorningAI's architecture, providing specific code examples here would be impractical. However, developers looking to understand how components interact can start with examining how the API server handles a request:

```python
# backend/api_server.py
from flask import Flask, request
from .tasks import process_request_async

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/process', methods=['POST'])
def process_request():
    data = request.json
    process_request_async.delay(data)
    return {"status": "Processing started"}, 202
```

This snippet shows a Flask route that receives requests and enqueues them for asynchronous processing using Redis Queue.

## Troubleshooting Tips

1. **Service Unavailability**: Ensure all Docker containers (if used) are up and running. Check Gunicorn logs for backend issues.
2. **Database Connection Issues**: Verify Supabase credentials are correct and network policies allow communication from your backend services.
3. **Task Queuing Delays**: Monitor Redis Queue dashboard for backlog of jobs. Consider scaling up workers if necessary.
