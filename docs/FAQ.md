# Testing Sentry Trace ID in MorningAI

This section aims to guide developers on how to test and utilize Sentry's `trace_id` within the MorningAI platform, ensuring efficient debugging and performance monitoring.

## Understanding Sentry `trace_id`

Sentry's `trace_id` is a unique identifier used to track the sequence of events or transactions in an application. It plays a crucial role in debugging by enabling developers to trace the flow of a request or process across various services and components. In the context of MorningAI, it helps in monitoring and identifying performance bottlenecks or issues within autonomous code generation, documentation management, and task orchestration workflows.

### How to Use `trace_id` in MorningAI

To implement and test Sentry's `trace_id` in MorningAI, follow these steps:

1. **Integration Setup**:
   Ensure that Sentry is correctly integrated into your MorningAI application. This typically involves setting up a Sentry SDK with your project's DSN (Data Source Name) in the Flask application configuration.

   ```python
   # Example setup in Flask (app/__init__.py)
   import sentry_sdk
   from sentry_sdk.integrations.flask import FlaskIntegration
   
   sentry_sdk.init(
       dsn="your_sentry_dsn_here",
       integrations=[FlaskIntegration()],
       traces_sample_rate=1.0  # Adjust sample rate as needed
   )
   ```

2. **Generating and Accessing `trace_id`**:
   After integrating Sentry, every event or transaction will have a `trace_id`. You can log this ID or pass it through HTTP headers for distributed tracing.

   ```python
   # Example of logging trace ID in an endpoint (app/routes.py)
   from flask import request, jsonify
   from sentry_sdk import Hub

   @app.route('/test_trace')
   def test_trace():
       trace_id = Hub.current.scope.span.trace_id
       return jsonify({"trace_id": trace_id}), 200
   ```

3. **Testing**:
   To test the functionality, make a request to your endpoint and verify that a unique `trace_id` is returned. You can then use this ID in Sentry's interface to trace the related transactions or events.

### Common Troubleshooting Tips

- **Missing Trace IDs**: If you're not seeing `trace_id`s in your logs or responses, ensure that the Sentry SDK is correctly initialized and that you have set a proper sample rate.
- **Incorrect Configuration**: Double-check your DSN and integration settings if Sentry does not seem to capture data. Misconfiguration can lead to silent failures.
- **Performance Overhead**: Be mindful of the `traces_sample_rate`. A high rate can provide more detailed traces but may introduce overhead to your application's performance.
