# Test Retry Success in MorningAI

Understanding how to manage and ensure the reliability of tests is crucial in maintaining the high quality of the MorningAI platform. This FAQ entry discusses the mechanism for retrying failed tests, ensuring that transient issues do not erroneously mark builds as failed.

## Explanation

In software testing, especially in an environment as dynamic and integrated as MorningAI, tests might fail due to transient issues unrelated to code quality or functionality, such as network latency or external service downtime. To mitigate this, MorningAI implements a retry mechanism that automatically reruns failed tests before marking a test as truly failed.

This feature helps in distinguishing between genuinely failing tests due to bugs or errors in the codebase and failures that occur due to temporary issues. By retrying failed tests, we reduce the likelihood of false positives disrupting development workflows and ensure that only persistent failures raise alerts.

## Code Example

The retry logic can be implemented directly within your test framework or via CI/CD pipeline configuration. Below is a simplified example using Python's `unittest` framework, assuming you're working on a Flask application tested with Gunicorn and Redis Queue:

```python
import unittest
from flask import Flask
from myapp import create_app  # Assuming your Flask app factory
from rq import Connection, Worker

class TestMyApp(unittest.TestCase):
    maxRetry = 3  # Maximum number of retries
    
    def setUp(self):
        self.app = create_app()
        self.client = self.app.test_client()
    
    def test_with_retry(self):
        attempt = 0
        while attempt < self.maxRetry:
            try:
                response = self.client.get('/some_endpoint')
                self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 200)
                break  # Exit loop if test passes
            except AssertionError as e:
                attempt += 1
                print(f"Retrying test, attempt {attempt}")
                if attempt == self.maxRetry:
                    raise e  # Reraise assertion error after final attempt
```

For CI/CD pipelines (e.g., using GitHub Actions), refer to your specific tool's documentation on implementing retries. Most modern CI/CD tools have built-in support for retry mechanisms.

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

1. **Ensure Network Stability**: Transient network issues are common causes of flaky tests. Ensure your testing environment has a stable internet connection.
2. **External Dependencies**: If your test relies on external services, consider mocking those services to reduce flakiness.
3. **Resource Allocation**: Insufficient resources (like memory and CPU time) can lead to timeouts and failures. Ensure your testing environment is adequately resourced.
4. **Concurrency Issues**: When working with databases or shared resources, ensure proper isolation between test cases to prevent data corruption or access conflicts.

Implementing a robust test retry mechanism enhances the reliability of the MorningAI development process by ensuring that only genuine failures are flagged for further investigation.
