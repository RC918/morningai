# Handling Redis Outage in MorningAI

Redis plays a crucial role in MorningAI's infrastructure, particularly for task orchestration and real-time operations. A Redis outage can impact various functionalities, from task queuing to session management. This FAQ aims to guide developers through steps to mitigate and resolve issues arising from a Redis outage, ensuring minimal disruption to the MorningAI platform.

## Understanding the Impact of a Redis Outage

When Redis becomes unavailable, the following features in MorningAI are directly affected:

- **Task Queuing:** MorningAI uses Redis Queue (RQ) for managing background jobs. An outage means tasks cannot be queued or processed.
- **Real-Time Orchestration:** Real-time task orchestration relies on Redis for managing state and communication between distributed components.
- **Session Management:** If Redis is used for session storage, an outage may result in user session loss or inability to create new sessions.

## Immediate Steps During an Outage

1. **Identify the Scope**: Determine if the outage is due to network issues, resource limitations, or configuration errors.
2. **Check System Health**: Use monitoring tools or logs to assess the health of the Redis instance.
   ```bash
   redis-cli ping
   ```
3. **Enable Read-Only Mode if Necessary**: To prevent data inconsistency, consider enabling a read-only mode that allows users to access data without making changes.

## Recovery Strategies

1. **Restart Redis Service**: Sometimes, a simple restart can resolve temporary issues.
   ```bash
   systemctl restart redis.service
   ```
2. **Assess Data Integrity**: After service restoration, check for any data inconsistencies or loss, especially for tasks that were queued but not processed.
3. **Scale Resources**: If the outage was due to resource constraints, consider scaling your Redis deployment vertically (more powerful instance) or horizontally (additional instances).

## Preventive Measures

- **Regular Backups**: Ensure you have regular backups of your Redis data to aid in recovery in case of data loss.
- **High Availability Setup**: Implement a high availability setup using Redis Sentinel or Cluster to minimize downtime risks.
- **Monitoring and Alerts**: Use tools like Prometheus or New Relic to monitor Redis performance metrics and set up alerts for abnormal patterns.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Connection Errors

Ensure your application's configuration matches the Redis server settings. Check firewall rules and network policies that might block communication between your application servers and Redis.

### Performance Degradation

Investigate slow queries using the `SLOWLOG` command and consider optimizing these operations. Monitor memory usage and configure eviction policies appropriately.

### Data Inconsistency

After an outage, ensure that tasks affected during the downtime are requeued or processed as needed. Validate session data integrity for user management functionalities.
