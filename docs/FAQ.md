# Testing Sentry `trace_id` in MorningAI

Sentry is an application monitoring platform that helps developers identify, triage, and fix crashes in real-time. In the context of MorningAI, Sentry is integral for tracking errors and performance issues across the platform. One of the key features of Sentry is its ability to trace errors and performance problems back to their source using a `trace_id`. This FAQ aims to guide developers on how to test and utilize Sentry's `trace_id` within the MorningAI platform.

## Understanding `trace_id`

The `trace_id` is a unique identifier used by Sentry to track a single transaction or series of related transactions through the system. It allows developers to pinpoint where errors occur and how they propagate through different services and requests. This is particularly useful in a distributed system like MorningAI, where a request may traverse multiple services and databases.

### How to Test `trace_id` in MorningAI

To test the `trace_id` functionality in MorningAI, follow these steps:

1. **Integration Setup**: Ensure that Sentry is properly integrated into the MorningAI platform. The integration process typically involves adding Sentry SDK to the project dependencies and configuring it with your DSN (Data Source Name). The basic setup should be present in your application's startup code, usually found in `app.py` or `settings.py`.

```python
import sentry_sdk
sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="your_sentry_dsn_here",
    traces_sample_rate=1.0 # Adjust sample rate as needed
)
```

2. **Generating Errors**: To test if Sentry captures errors with a `trace_id`, you can intentionally generate an error or use an existing endpoint known to cause issues under certain conditions. For instance:

```python
@app.route('/generate-error')
def trigger_error():
    division_by_zero = 1 / 0  # This will cause a ZeroDivisionError
    return "This should not be reached"
```

3. **Checking Sentry Dashboard**: After triggering an error, check your Sentry dashboard for the reported issue. You should see the error along with its associated `trace_id`. This ID can be used to trace the error's path through your application.

### Common Troubleshooting Tips

- **Missing Errors**: If errors do not appear in your Sentry dashboard, ensure that your DSN is correctly configured and that there are no network issues preventing data from being sent.
  
- **Sampling Rate**: If you notice missing transactions or think too much data is being sent, adjust the `traces_sample_rate` in your Sentry initialization code. A lower rate means less data will be captured and sent.

- **Performance Issues**: Capturing a high volume of transactions can impact application performance. Monitor your application's performance and adjust sampling rates as necessary.

- **Verify Integration**: Use Sentry's test utilities or intentionally generate an error (as shown above) to verify that integration is successful and that Sentry is capturing data as expected.

Remember, testing and adjusting configurations based on your specific needs are crucial for effectively using Sentry within any application, including MorningAI.
