# MorningAI System Architecture

MorningAI's system architecture is designed to provide a robust, scalable platform for autonomous code generation, FAQ generation, documentation management, and multi-platform integration. Our architecture facilitates real-time task orchestration and vector memory storage, ensuring high performance and reliability for developers and users alike.

## Components Overview

The architecture of MorningAI comprises several key components working together:

- **Frontend**: Developed with React, utilizing Vite for build optimization and TailwindCSS for styling. This setup offers a fast, responsive UI that is easy to customize.
- **Backend**: Powered by Python with Flask as the web framework and Gunicorn as the WSGI HTTP server with multi-worker support. This combination provides a powerful, efficient backend capable of handling multiple requests concurrently.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL is used for data storage, enhanced with Supabase for additional functionalities like Row Level Security (RLS), making data access secure and efficient.
- **Queue System**: Redis Queue (RQ) is employed for managing background tasks, allowing for asynchronous task processing which improves overall application performance.
- **Orchestration**: LangGraph is utilized for orchestrating agent workflows, enabling complex task sequences to be executed efficiently.
- **AI Component**: OpenAI's GPT-4 powers the content generation features of MorningAI, providing state-of-the-art natural language processing capabilities.
- **Deployment**: The platform is deployed on Render.com, benefiting from its continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines which streamline updates and maintenance.

## Code Example: Setting Up a Worker in Redis Queue

Here's a simple example of how you might set up a worker in Redis Queue within the MorningAI platform:

```python
from rq import Worker, Queue, Connection
import os
from redis import Redis

redis_url = os.getenv('REDIS_URL', 'redis://localhost:6379')
conn = Redis.from_url(redis_url)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    with Connection(conn):
        worker = Worker(list(map(Queue, ['default'])), connection=conn)
        worker.work()
```

This script demonstrates setting up a worker that listens on the 'default' queue. Ensure that your environment variable `REDIS_URL` is set correctly to your Redis instance URL.

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

1. **Issue**: Workers not picking up jobs in Redis Queue.
   - **Solution**: Ensure that your workers are running and connected to the correct Redis instance. Check your environment variables (`REDIS_URL`) and logs for any connection errors.

2. **Issue**: Database migrations failing on Supabase.
   - **Solution**: Verify that your migration scripts are compatible with PostgreSQL syntax and that you have sufficient permissions set through RLS policies.

3. **Issue**: Frontend changes not reflecting after deployment.
   - **Solution**: Clear your browser cache or use hard reload to ensure you're not seeing cached versions of your site. Also, check Render.com's deployment logs for any build or deployment errors.

Remember to consult the individual component documentation linked above for more detailed troubleshooting guides specific to each technology.
