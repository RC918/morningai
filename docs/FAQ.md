# Test Retry Mechanism in MorningAI

The test retry mechanism in MorningAI is designed to enhance the stability and reliability of our testing process by automatically rerunning failed tests a specified number of times. This feature is particularly useful in a distributed and asynchronous environment, where transient issues such as network latency, temporary unavailability of external services, or flaky tests can cause tests to fail intermittently.

## Understanding the Test Retry Mechanism

MorningAI employs a robust test retry mechanism that allows developers to specify the number of retries for failed tests within the test framework. This mechanism is built into our continuous integration (CI) pipeline to ensure that transient failures do not unnecessarily block the development process.

### Configuration

To configure test retries, you need to modify the test framework's configuration file. The specific steps can vary depending on the testing framework used (e.g., pytest, unittest). Here is an example using pytest with the `pytest-rerunfailures` plugin:

```python
# In pytest.ini or conftest.py
def pytest_addoption(parser):
    parser.addoption("--reruns", action="repeat", default=2, help="number of times to rerun failed tests")
```

This configuration would automatically retry any failed test up to two times before marking it as a failure.

### Implementing in CI Pipeline

In your CI pipeline configuration (e.g., `.gitlab-ci.yml`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`), ensure to include steps that install necessary plugins or dependencies and use the configured retry option. For instance:

```yaml
test_job:
  script:
    - pip install pytest pytest-rerunfailures
    - pytest --reruns 2
```

### Using with MorningAI's Stack

Given MorningAI's technology stack involves Python and Flask for backend operations, incorporating test retries would typically involve adjusting your `pytest` configurations as demonstrated above. Ensure your test environment is properly set up to handle retries seamlessly by including necessary dependencies in your `requirements.txt` or `Pipfile`.

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

1. **Tests Not Retrying**: Ensure the retry plugin is installed and correctly configured in your test framework's configuration file.
2. **Retries Exacerbating Flaky Tests**: If retries seem to make flakiness worse, review your tests for underlying race conditions or dependencies on external state.
3. **Performance Impact**: Be mindful that retries can increase the total time taken for your test suite to run. Use retries judiciously and focus on fixing flaky tests where possible.

Remember, while the retry mechanism can help mitigate the impact of flaky tests, it is not a substitute for addressing the root causes of test instability.
