# Test Retry Success in MorningAI

Ensuring the reliability and stability of applications is critical, especially in platforms like MorningAI, where autonomous agents, real-time task orchestration, and AI-driven features are core functionalities. Implementing a robust test retry mechanism can significantly enhance the resilience of your application by reducing the chances of transient failures causing your build or deployment processes to fail. This FAQ aims to explain how to utilize test retries within the MorningAI platform context effectively.

## Understanding Test Retries

Test retries are a mechanism that allows failing tests to be automatically re-executed a predetermined number of times before being marked as failed. This approach is particularly useful for addressing flaky tests that might fail intermittently due to temporary issues such as network latency, dependencies on external services, or parallel execution conflicts.

In the context of MorningAI's technology stack, implementing test retries can be achieved at various levels, including during automated testing in CI/CD pipelines or within the application code itself, especially for integration and end-to-end tests.

### Implementing Test Retries in CI/CD Pipelines

Most modern CI/CD platforms, including Render.com which MorningAI uses for deployment, support test retries either natively or through plugins/extensions. To configure test retries in your CI/CD pipeline, you would typically adjust your pipeline configuration file.

For example, if using GitHub Actions for your CI/CD:

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: '3.8'
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        pip install flask gunicorn
        pip install pytest pytest-flask
    - name: Run tests with retry
      uses: nick-invision/retry@v2
      with:
        timeout_minutes: 10
        max_attempts: 3
        command: pytest tests/
```

This example demonstrates how to retry tests up to three times if they fail.

### Implementing Test Retries Within Application Code

For more granular control, especially useful in integration and end-to-end testing within the MorningAI platform (e.g., when testing autonomous agent systems or multi-platform integrations), you can implement retry logic directly in your test code. Python's `retrying` package is an excellent tool for this purpose.

```python
from retrying import retry

@retry(stop_max_attempt_number=3, wait_fixed=2000)
def test_function_that_might_fail():
    # Your test code here. This function will be retried up to 3 times if it raises an exception.
    assert potentially_flaky_function() == expected_result
```

This code snippet shows how to use the `retry` decorator from the `retrying` package to automatically retry a flaky test function.

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

- **Ensure Idempotency:** Make sure that your tests are idempotent and can be safely retried without causing side effects.
- **Adjust Retry Parameters:** If you're still encountering flakiness after implementing retries, consider adjusting the retry parameters (e.g., increasing the number of attempts or the wait time between retries).
- **Investigate Root Causes:** While test retries can mitigate the impact of flaky tests, it's crucial to investigate and address their root causes whenever possible to improve overall stability.

Implementing and configuring test retries properly can greatly enhance the resilience of your continuous integration and testing processes within the MorningAI platform. By following these guidelines and utilizing the provided examples, developers can ensure more reliable build outcomes and a smoother development workflow.
