# Testing Sentry `trace_id` in MorningAI

This FAQ aims to guide developers through the process of testing and using Sentry's `trace_id` within the MorningAI platform. The `trace_id` is crucial for tracing errors and performance issues across distributed systems, ensuring efficient debugging and system monitoring.

## What is Sentry `trace_id`?

Sentry uses `trace_id` as part of its distributed tracing system to monitor and troubleshoot issues across microservices or other distributed systems. It helps in identifying the path taken by a request or a job through various services, making it easier to pinpoint where failures or performance bottlenecks occur.

## How to Test Sentry `trace_id` in MorningAI

To test the Sentry `trace_id` within the MorningAI platform, you need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Configuration

Ensure that Sentry is properly configured in your MorningAI application. This typically involves setting up the Sentry DSN (Data Source Name) in your environment variables and initializing Sentry in your application code.

**Example Initialization (Python with Flask):**

```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.flask import FlaskIntegration

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="your_sentry_dsn_here",
    integrations=[FlaskIntegration()],
    traces_sample_rate=1.0 # Adjust sampling rate as needed
)
```

### Step 2: Generating a `trace_id`

When implementing a new feature or service within MorningAI, use Sentry's API to generate a `trace_id`. This ID should be passed along with any requests or jobs being processed.

**Example Code Snippet:**

```python
from sentry_sdk import start_transaction

with start_transaction(op="task", name="YourTaskName") as transaction:
    # Your code here
    # Optionally, modify transaction context or set custom tags as needed
    transaction.set_tag("key", "value")
```

### Step 3: Testing and Verification

To test if the `trace_id` is being correctly used and monitored, trigger the functionality where the tracing is implemented. You can then go to your Sentry dashboard to verify that the traces are appearing as expected. Look for transactions or traces with your specified operation (`op`) and name (`name`) tags.

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

- **Traces Not Appearing**: If traces are not appearing in Sentry, check that your DSN is correctly configured and that your sampling rate is not set too low.
- **Incorrect Trace Data**: Ensure that each part of your application generating traces has unique operation names (`op`) and descriptive names to avoid confusion.
- **Performance Issues**: High sampling rates can impact application performance. Adjust your sampling rate based on production traffic and necessity.

Remember, effective use of Sentry's tracing system can significantly improve the observability of your application, helping you quickly diagnose and resolve issues.
