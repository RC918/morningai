# MorningAI System Architecture

The MorningAI platform is designed as a multi-tenant Software as a Service (SaaS) solution, leveraging a robust and scalable architecture to support autonomous code generation, FAQ generation, documentation management, and multi-platform integration. This comprehensive overview will help developers understand the underlying architecture of MorningAI, how it operates, and how they can effectively interact with it.

## Overview

MorningAI's architecture is built to facilitate efficient real-time task orchestration and vector memory storage, ensuring high performance and scalability. The system integrates several key technologies and frameworks to achieve its goals:

- **Frontend**: Utilizes React along with Vite for bundling and TailwindCSS for styling. This combination offers a fast and responsive user interface that adapts seamlessly across devices.
  
- **Backend**: Built on Python with Flask serving as the web framework, and Gunicorn configured with multi-worker support for handling multiple requests concurrently.

- **Database**: PostgreSQL is used for data storage, enhanced with Row Level Security (RLS) for improved data integrity and privacy. Supabase is integrated to augment PostgreSQL capabilities, providing additional functionalities like authentication and real-time subscriptions.

- **Queue**: Redis Queue (RQ) is employed for managing background tasks, supported by worker heartbeat monitoring to ensure reliability in task execution.

- **Orchestration**: LangGraph orchestrates agent workflows, facilitating complex operations and interactions within the system.

- **AI**: OpenAI's GPT-4 drives the content generation capabilities of MorningAI, enabling sophisticated document and FAQ generation.

- **Deployment**: Render.com is used for hosting with Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD), ensuring smooth updates and maintenance.

### Code Example: Worker Initialization

```python
from rq import Worker, Queue, Connection
import redis

redis_url = "redis://localhost:6379"
conn = redis.from_url(redis_url)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    with Connection(conn):
        worker = Worker(map(Queue, ['default']))
        worker.work()
```

This example demonstrates initializing a worker for Redis Queue (RQ), which listens to the default queue for tasks to process in the background.

## Troubleshooting Tips

1. **Gunicorn Workers Not Starting**: Ensure you have set the correct number of workers in your `gunicorn.conf.py`. Also, check system logs for any errors related to port binding or permissions.
2. **Redis Queue Job Stuck**: Verify the Redis server's health and connectivity. Ensure workers are running and listening to the correct queues. Use RQ Dashboard or command-line tools to inspect job statuses.
3. **Database Connectivity Issues**: For PostgreSQL connection issues, confirm your database URL and credentials are correctly set in your environment variables or configuration files. Check if RLS policies are interfering with expected operations.
4. **Failed Deployments on Render.com**: Review deployment logs on Render.com for specific error messages. Common issues include exceeded build times or failed health checks post-deployment.
