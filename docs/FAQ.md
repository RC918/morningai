# System Architecture of MorningAI

MorningAI leverages a modern, scalable, and flexible system architecture designed to accommodate the needs of autonomous agent systems for code generation, efficient FAQ generation, documentation management, and seamless multi-platform integration. Below is a detailed explanation of each component within the MorningAI platform, their roles, and how they interact with each other.

## Overview

The MorningAI platform is built upon a microservices architecture pattern, utilizing various technologies across its stack to ensure reliability, performance, and ease of use. The primary components include:

- **Frontend:** Developed with React, Vite, and TailwindCSS for a responsive and modern user interface.
- **Backend:** Utilizes Python with Flask and Gunicorn for handling API requests efficiently across multiple workers.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL via Supabase with Row Level Security (RLS) to ensure data integrity and security.
- **Queue System:** Redis Queue (RQ) is used for managing background tasks with worker heartbeat monitoring to ensure task health.
- **Orchestration:** LangGraph handles the workflow of autonomous agents within the system.
- **AI Integration:** OpenAI's GPT-4 is integrated for advanced content generation capabilities.
- **Deployment:** Render.com provides CI/CD for seamless deployment and updates.

## Detailed Components Description

### Frontend

The frontend is built using React for its component-based architecture allowing reusable UI elements. Vite is chosen for fast builds and HMR (Hot Module Replacement), while TailwindCSS offers utility-first CSS for rapid styling without leaving the HTML.

```javascript
// Example: Setup Vite with React
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()]
});
```

### Backend

For backend services, Python's Flask framework offers simplicity and extensibility. Gunicorn serves as the WSGI HTTP Server to handle requests with multi-worker support for scalability.

```python
# Example: Running Flask app with Gunicorn
# gunicorn command: gunicorn -w 4 myapp:app
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello, World!'
```

### Database

PostgreSQL on Supabase provides a robust database solution with RLS for fine-grained access control. Supabase simplifies setup and scaling of PostgreSQL databases.

```sql
-- Example: Enabling Row Level Security on a table
CREATE TABLE projects (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT,
    owner_id INTEGER
);
ALTER TABLE projects ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

### Queue System

Redis Queue (RQ) manages background jobs that are crucial for task orchestration without blocking the main application flow. Worker heartbeat monitoring ensures that each worker is alive and processing tasks.

```python
# Example: Enqueueing a job with RQ
from redis import Redis
from rq import Queue

q = Queue(connection=Redis())
job = q.enqueue('my_function', args=(myarg,))
```

### Orchestration

LangGraph orchestrates the workflow among different agents in the system, ensuring efficient task execution according to predefined workflows.

### AI Integration

Integration with OpenAI's GPT-4 enables MorningAI to generate content dynamically based on user input or system-generated queries.

### Deployment

Render.com automates deployment and CI/CD processes, making it easy to roll out updates and maintain the application without downtime.

## Troubleshooting Tips

1. **Frontend Issues:** Ensure all node modules are correctly installed (`npm install`) and check console logs for errors.
2. **Backend Connectivity:** Verify that Gunicorn is configured correctly with Flask (`gunicorn app:app`) and that environment variables are set properly.
3. **Database Access:** Confirm that RLS policies are not overly restrictive preventing legitimate access to data.
4. **Queue Jobs Stuck:** Check Redis Queue dashboard for failed jobs and inspect logs for exceptions or configuration issues.
5. **Deployment Failures:** Review Render.com build logs for errors during build or deployment phases.
