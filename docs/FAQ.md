# Handling Redis Outage in MorningAI

MorningAI relies on Redis Queue (RQ) for managing real-time task orchestration. A Redis outage can significantly impact the platform's ability to process tasks, affecting both the autonomous agent system and real-time task orchestration. This guide provides insights into understanding, mitigating, and recovering from a Redis outage within the context of MorningAI.

## Understanding the Impact of a Redis Outage

When Redis experiences an outage, MorningAI's task queue becomes unresponsive. This means:

- Task submissions will either fail or remain pending, causing delays in code generation and documentation management.
- Real-time updates and notifications across integrated platforms (Telegram, LINE, Messenger) may not be dispatched.
- Worker heartbeat monitoring via RQ is disrupted, complicating the oversight of active processes.

## Mitigation Strategies

### 1. Immediate Action Plan
Upon detecting a Redis outage, follow these steps:

1. **Pause Incoming Tasks**: Temporarily halt new task submissions to prevent a backlog.
2. **Notify Users**: Use your communication channels to inform users about the issue and the expected timeline for resolution.

### 2. Code Example: Pausing Task Submissions
To programmatically pause new tasks, you might set a global flag in your Flask application that checks the status of Redis before accepting new tasks:

```python
from flask import Flask, jsonify
import redis

app = Flask(__name__)
redis_conn = None

try:
    redis_conn = redis.Redis(host='localhost', port=6379)
except redis.RedisError:
    pass  # Handle connection error

@app.route('/submit_task', methods=['POST'])
def submit_task():
    if redis_conn is None or not redis_conn.ping():
        return jsonify({"error": "Task submission is temporarily paused due to backend issues."}), 503
    # Task submission logic here

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

### 3. Recovery and Restoration
Once Redis is back online:

1. **Clear Task Backlog**: Prioritize tasks that were pending during the outage.
2. **System Health Check**: Ensure all components are functioning correctly with Redis Queue.

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

- **Redis Connection Issues**: Verify that your Redis instance is running and accessible. Check firewall settings and network connectivity.
- **Monitoring Worker Health**: Use RQ Dashboard to monitor worker status. In case of failures, restart workers after ensuring Redis is fully operational.
- **Data Persistence**: After an outage, ensure data persistence settings in Redis are correctly configured to prevent data loss.
