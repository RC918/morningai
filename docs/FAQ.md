# Testing Sentry Trace ID in MorningAI

## Understanding Sentry Trace ID in MorningAI

In MorningAI, Sentry is utilized for error tracking and performance monitoring, ensuring that any issues within the application can be quickly identified and resolved. A critical component of this integration is the Sentry `trace_id`, which uniquely identifies a set of operations (or a "trace") across multiple systems, services, or transactions. This identifier is invaluable for debugging by linking errors and performance issues directly to their source operations.

### How to Use Sentry Trace ID

To effectively use Sentry trace IDs within MorningAI, developers need to incorporate Sentry's SDK into their application code. Here's a brief overview of how you can do this:

1. **Initialization**: Ensure that the Sentry SDK is initialized at the start of your application. This should include your DSN (Data Source Name) and any relevant configuration to capture performance data.

    ```python
    import sentry_sdk
    sentry_sdk.init(
        dsn="your_sentry_dsn_here",
        traces_sample_rate=1.0  # Adjust sampling rate as necessary
    )
    ```

2. **Capture Trace ID**: When an operation begins, you can capture its trace ID by creating a new transaction or capturing it from an existing one.

    ```python
    with sentry_sdk.start_transaction(op="task", name="My Operation"):
        # Your operation code here
        # The trace_id is automatically attached to errors and performance data
    ```

3. **Logging and Sharing Trace IDs**: If you need to log or share a trace ID (for example, for debugging purposes), you can retrieve it from the current transaction.

    ```python
    current_transaction = sentry_sdk.Hub.current.scope.transaction
    if current_transaction:
        print(f"Current Transaction Trace ID: {current_transaction.trace_id}")
    ```

For more detailed information on integrating Sentry with your Python applications, including advanced configurations and usage scenarios, refer to the official [Sentry Python SDK documentation](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/).

### Common Troubleshooting Tips

- **Missing Trace IDs**: If you're not seeing trace IDs where you expect them, ensure that:
  - The Sentry SDK has been correctly initialized at the start of your application.
  - Transactions are being correctly started (and closed) around your operations.
  - The `traces_sample_rate` is set to an appropriate value (setting it too low may result in missing data).

- **Incorrectly Linked Errors/Transactions**: Make sure that transactions are not being prematurely closed, and that any asynchronous operations are correctly awaited or tracked within their parent transaction.

- **Performance Overhead**: While capturing detailed tracing information is invaluable for debugging, be mindful of the `traces_sample_rate` setting. Capturing every transaction may introduce unnecessary overhead, particularly in high-throughput environments.
