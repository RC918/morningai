# MorningAI System Architecture

MorningAI's system architecture is designed to provide a robust, scalable, and efficient platform for autonomous code generation, documentation management, and real-time task orchestration. The architecture leverages a modern stack including React, Flask, PostgreSQL (with Supabase), Redis Queue (RQ), and OpenAI GPT-4, among others. This comprehensive guide aims to help developers understand the key components and how they interact within the MorningAI ecosystem.

## Overview

At its core, MorningAI's architecture is divided into several key components:

- **Frontend**: Developed with React, utilizing Vite for build optimization and TailwindCSS for styling.
- **Backend**: A Python Flask application handles API requests, interfaced with Gunicorn for multi-worker support to enhance concurrency.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL through Supabase, incorporating Row Level Security (RLS) for data integrity and security.
- **Queue System**: Redis Queue (RQ) manages task queuing and execution, ensuring efficient real-time operations.
- **Orchestration**: Utilizes LangGraph for managing complex workflows of the autonomous agent system.
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI GPT-4 powers the content generation including FAQ generation and code suggestions.
- **Deployment**: Hosted on Render.com with continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.

### Frontend

```jsx
// Example of setting up a React component with TailwindCSS
import React from 'react';

const HelloWorld = () => (
  <div className="p-4 max-w-sm mx-auto bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg flex items-center space-x-4">
    <div>
      <div className="text-xl font-medium text-black">Hello World!</div>
      <p className="text-gray-500">You're up and running with React & TailwindCSS.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
);

export default HelloWorld;
```

### Backend

Flask app setup example:

```python
from flask import Flask
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
from config import Config

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config.from_object(Config)
db = SQLAlchemy(app)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

### Database Configuration

Using Supabase for PostgreSQL setup:

```sql
-- Setting up a table with Row Level Security
CREATE TABLE my_table (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    data TEXT NOT NULL
);
ALTER TABLE my_table ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

### Queue System

Setting up a task with Redis Queue:

```python
from rq import Queue
from redis import Redis
from my_module import count_words_at_url

redis_conn = Redis()
q = Queue(connection=redis_conn)

result = q.enqueue(count_words_at_url, 'http://example.com')
```

### AI Integration

Integrating OpenAI GPT-4 for content generation is handled within the backend services but requires appropriate API usage as per OpenAI's documentation.

### Deployment Configuration

Example `render.yaml` snippet for CI/CD on Render.com:

```yaml
services:
  - type: web
    name: morningai-web
    env: python
    plan: starter
    buildCommand: "pip install -r requirements.txt && npm run build"
    startCommand: "gunicorn app:app --worker-class gevent --workers 4 --bind :10000"
```

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

**Issue**: Application not responding post-deployment on Render.com  
**Solution**: Ensure that the `startCommand` in `render.yaml` correctly points to your Flask app instance. Also, verify that all required environment variables are correctly set in Render's dashboard.

**Issue**: Tasks not executing or delayed in Redis Queue  
**Solution**: Check for sufficient resources in your Redis instance. Monitor the queue size and worker availability via RQ Dashboard. Ensure workers are not overwhelmed by adjusting concurrency settings or scaling workers horizontally.

**Issue**: Database migrations failing after enabling RLS  
**Solution**: Ensure all migration scripts account for RLS policies and that you have default roles set up correctly in PostgreSQL. Use Supabase's dashboard or direct SQL commands to manage roles and permissions carefully.
