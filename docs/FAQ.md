# System Architecture of MorningAI

The MorningAI platform is designed as a multi-tenant Software as a Service (SaaS) solution, leveraging a modern technology stack to provide an autonomous agent system for code generation, FAQ generation, documentation management, multi-platform integration, real-time task orchestration with Redis Queue, and vector memory storage with pgvector/Supabase. This document provides an overview of the system architecture to aid developers in understanding and utilizing the MorningAI platform effectively.

## Overview

MorningAI's architecture is built to be scalable, efficient, and modular, allowing for easy integration and expansion. The core components of the system include:

- **Frontend:** Utilizes React for the UI components, managed by Vite for an optimized development environment and styled with TailwindCSS for a flexible layout design.
- **Backend:** Written in Python using Flask as the web framework, with Gunicorn serving as the WSGI HTTP Server to handle requests with multi-worker support for scalability.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL is used for data storage, enhanced with Row Level Security (RLS) features from Supabase for data integrity and security.
- **Queue System:** Redis Queue (RQ) is employed for managing background tasks, providing a robust system for real-time task orchestration.
- **Orchestration:** LangGraph is used for defining and managing agent workflows within the platform.
- **AI Integration:** OpenAI's GPT-4 model powers the content generation aspects of the platform, including FAQ generation and documentation management.
- **Deployment:** Render.com is used for hosting with continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) to streamline development cycles.

## Code Examples

While specific code examples depend on the context of use, here are some general snippets to illustrate how components might interact within the MorningAI architecture:

### Flask Application Initialization

```python
from flask import Flask
from config import Config

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config.from_object(Config)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()
```

### Gunicorn Configuration Example

`gunicorn.conf.py`

```python
workers = 2
threads = 4
timeout = 120
```

This configuration can be tailored based on the deployment environment requirements.

### Redis Queue Task Example

```python
import redis
from rq import Queue

r = redis.Redis()
q = Queue(connection=r)

def background_task(arg):
    print(f"Running task with argument {arg}")
    # Task implementation here

job = q.enqueue(background_task, 'example')
```

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

**1. Gunicorn Workers Crashing**: Ensure that your server has adequate resources. You may need to adjust the number of workers based on available memory and CPU cores.

**2. Database Connection Issues**: Verify your database URL and credentials. Check if Row Level Security policies are correctly configured if encountering permission errors.

**3. Task Delays in Redis Queue**: Monitor your queue sizes and worker availability. Consider scaling up workers or optimizing task execution times.

**4. Deployment Failures on Render.com**: Review build logs for any errors during the CI/CD process. Ensure all environment variables are correctly set up in your Render dashboard.

For detailed troubleshooting steps and community support, refer to each component's official documentation or forums.
