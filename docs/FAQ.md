# System Architecture of MorningAI

MorningAI is designed as a scalable, multi-tenant SaaS platform focusing on autonomous agent systems for code generation, FAQ generation, documentation management, and multi-platform integration. Its architecture is built to handle real-time task orchestration and vector memory storage efficiently. Below is a detailed overview of MorningAI's system architecture components and how they interconnect.

## Frontend

The frontend is developed using **React**, optimized with **Vite** for faster builds, and styled using **TailwindCSS** for utility-first CSS management. This setup allows for a highly responsive and customizable user interface that adapts seamlessly across different devices and platforms.

```jsx
// Example of a React component with TailwindCSS
import React from 'react';

const WelcomeBanner = () => {
  return (
    <div className="bg-blue-500 text-white text-xl p-4">
      Welcome to MorningAI
    </div>
  );
};

export default WelcomeBanner;
```

## Backend

At its core, the backend leverages **Python** with **Flask** as the web framework, running on **Gunicorn** as the WSGI HTTP Server with multi-worker support for handling concurrent requests efficiently. This combination offers robust performance and scalability for web applications.

```python
# Example Flask application setup
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello, MorningAI!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

## Database

MorningAI uses **PostgreSQL** for its database needs, enhanced by **Supabase** for additional functionalities such as Row Level Security (RLS), which provides fine-grained access control to ensure data privacy and security across multi-tenant environments.

```sql
-- Example PostgreSQL query with RLS
CREATE POLICY tenant_isolation_policy ON public.users
FOR ALL USING (tenant_id = current_setting('app.tenant_id'));
```

## Queue System

For managing asynchronous tasks and orchestrations, MorningAI implements **Redis Queue (RQ)**. It handles task queuing to distribute work across multiple workers, thereby improving the efficiency of real-time operations.

```python
# Example of enqueuing a task with RQ
from redis import Redis
from rq import Queue

q = Queue(connection=Redis())

result = q.enqueue('my_function', args=(my_arg,))
```

## Orchestration

The system uses **LangGraph** for defining and executing agent workflows. This enables complex task orchestration within the platform, allowing autonomous agents to perform code generation and content creation tasks effectively.

```yaml
# Example LangGraph definition for an agent workflow
steps:
  - name: gather_information
    action: fetch_data_from_source
  - name: generate_code
    action: run_code_generation_model
```

## AI Integration

For generating content, including FAQ sections like this one, MorningAI integrates **OpenAI GPT-4**, ensuring high-quality, contextually relevant text generation. This AI model supports various features such as understanding natural language queries and generating code snippets.

## Deployment

Deployment is managed through **Render.com**, utilizing continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines to streamline updates and ensure that the latest version of the platform is always available without downtime.

## Troubleshooting Tips

- Ensure all environment variables are correctly set up for database connections, especially when dealing with PostgreSQL RLS.
- When encountering issues with task processing in Redis Queue, check the worker logs for errors or missed heartbeats.
- For frontend issues related to React or TailwindCSS, verify your project dependencies are up to date and compatible.
