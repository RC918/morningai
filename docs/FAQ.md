# Test Retry Mechanism in MorningAI

MorningAI incorporates a robust test retry mechanism designed to enhance the reliability and stability of its autonomous agent system and overall platform functionality. This feature is particularly beneficial for managing flaky tests or external dependencies that might occasionally fail due to transient issues. Understanding how to implement and utilize this mechanism can significantly improve your development workflow within the MorningAI ecosystem.

## Understanding Test Retries

Test retries provide a way to automatically rerun failed tests before marking them as failures. This capability is crucial for mitigating the impact of nondeterministic errors, such as network instability or temporary service outages, on your continuous integration (CI) pipeline.

### How It Works

The retry mechanism in MorningAI is integrated into the test framework used by the platform, typically via configuration settings or decorators that specify the number of retry attempts for a given test. When a test fails, the system will automatically attempt to rerun it based on the defined criteria before conclusively determining its failure.

### Configuration

To configure test retries in MorningAI, you need to modify the testing configuration file, usually located at `tests/config.py` or directly within your test suite using decorators. Here's an example using Python's unittest framework:

```python
import unittest
from morningai.retry import retry_on_failure

@retry_on_failure(retries=3)
class MyTestCase(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_example(self):
        # Your test code here
        self.assertEqual('foo'.upper(), 'FOO')
```

In this example, `retry_on_failure` is a hypothetical decorator provided by MorningAI to enable retry logic. The `retries=3` parameter indicates that the test should be rerun up to three times if it fails before finally being marked as failed.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Test Still Fails After Maximum Retries

If a test continues to fail even after the maximum number of retries:
1. **Investigate Persistent Issues**: Consider whether the test is uncovering a consistent bug or issue with the application.
2. **Review Test Stability**: Evaluate if the test itself is flaky and needs refinement.
3. **External Dependencies**: Check any external services or APIs for ongoing issues.

### Incorrect Retry Behavior

- **Configuration Mistakes**: Ensure that the retry decorator is correctly applied and configured.
- **Interference from Other Decorators/Test Framework Features**: Some testing frameworks or additional decorators might interfere with retry logic. Review documentation and implementation details for compatibility notes.
