# Testing Sentry `trace_id` in MorningAI

Sentry is a powerful error tracking software that helps developers monitor and fix crashes in real time. The `trace_id` is a unique identifier for each transaction or span, enabling you to trace the flow of a request through your application to diagnose performance issues and errors. In MorningAI, integrating Sentry with a focus on utilizing `trace_id` enhances error tracking and debugging capabilities significantly.

## Understanding `trace_id` in Sentry

Each transaction in Sentry is assigned a `trace_id`, which can be used to correlate all spans participating in the transaction. This is particularly useful in distributed systems where a request passes through multiple services. By examining the `trace_id`, developers can trace the path of a request across different parts of the system and identify where failures or bottlenecks occur.

### How to Test `trace_id` in MorningAI

To test the `trace_id` functionality within MorningAI, you'll need to ensure Sentry is properly set up and integrated into your application. Below are steps and code examples to help you get started:

#### 1. Sentry Setup

Ensure Sentry SDK is installed and configured in your MorningAI project. This typically involves adding Sentry as a dependency and initializing it with your DSN (Data Source Name).

```python
# Install Sentry SDK
pip install --upgrade sentry-sdk

# Initialize Sentry in your application (e.g., app.py)
import sentry_sdk
sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="your_sentry_dsn_here",
    traces_sample_rate=1.0 # Adjust sampling rate as needed
)
```

#### 2. Generating and Retrieving `trace_id`

When an error or transaction occurs, Sentry automatically assigns a `trace_id`. You can retrieve and log this ID for debugging purposes:

```python
from sentry_sdk import Hub

def my_function():
    try:
        # Your code logic here
        pass
    except Exception as e:
        current_hub = Hub.current
        trace_id = current_hub.last_event_id()
        print(f"Trace ID for debugging: {trace_id}")
        raise e
```

#### 3. Testing with Mock Transactions

To simulate transactions for testing the traceability:

```python
from sentry_sdk import start_transaction

with start_transaction(op="test", name="Test Transaction"):
    # Simulate your application logic that you want to trace
    pass  # Replace with actual logic

# Check your Sentry dashboard for the transaction and its trace_id.
```

### Common Troubleshooting Tips

- **Missing Trace IDs**: Ensure that the Sentry SDK initialization code runs before any other part of your application that might throw errors or create transactions.
- **Sampling Rate**: A low traces sample rate may result in missing transactions. Adjust `traces_sample_rate` during initialization to capture more or fewer transactions.
- **Check Configuration**: Verify that your DSN is correct and that there are no network issues preventing data from being sent to Sentry.

Integrating Sentry's tracing capabilities into MorningAI enables detailed insight into application performance and error diagnostics. By effectively testing and utilizing `trace_id`, developers can enhance observability across services, leading to quicker identification and resolution of issues.
