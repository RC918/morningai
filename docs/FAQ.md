# Test Retry Success in MorningAI

Understanding and implementing test retries is crucial for maintaining the reliability of the MorningAI platform. This FAQ aims to guide developers through the process of configuring and utilizing test retries, ensuring that transient errors or flaky tests don't hinder continuous integration and development processes.

## Explanation of Test Retry Mechanism

Test retries in MorningAI are designed to automatically rerun failed tests before marking them as failures. This mechanism helps to mitigate issues caused by non-deterministic environments, network inconsistencies, or temporary service outages. By retrying a test that initially fails, we can increase the reliability of our testing suite and reduce false negatives.

### Configuring Test Retries

Test retries can be configured at both the suite and individual test levels, allowing developers to customize the retry logic based on the test's stability or requirements.

#### Suite-Level Configuration

To configure retries for all tests within a suite, you can modify the test configuration file (usually located in `test/config.py` or similar). Here's an example using pytest:

```python
# In pytest.ini or conftest.py
def pytest_configure(config):
    config.addinivalue_line("reruns", 3) # Retry each test up to 3 times
    config.addinivalue_line("reruns_delay", 5) # Wait for 5 seconds between each retry
```

#### Individual Test Configuration

For more granular control, you may want to specify retries for individual tests. This can be done using decorators or test properties depending on your testing framework. Here's how you might do it with pytest:

```python
import pytest

@pytest.mark.flaky(reruns=5, reruns_delay=2)
def test_example():
    # Your test code here
```

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

While test retries are a powerful feature, they come with their own set of challenges. Here are some common issues and how to resolve them:

- **Tests Still Failing After Retries**: Ensure that the issue is indeed transient. If a test consistently fails, it may indicate a genuine problem with the code rather than a flaky test.
  
- **Retries Making Tests Too Slow**: If adding retries significantly increases your test suite's runtime, consider isolating flaky tests into their own suite or increasing hardware resources.
  
- **Determining Optimal Retry Count**: Finding the right balance for retry attempts is crucial. Start with a lower count and adjust based on your observations of the tests' behavior over time.

Remember, while retries can help mitigate the impact of flaky tests, they're not a substitute for fixing underlying issues causing the flakiness.
