# Testing Sentry `trace_id` in MorningAI

Sentry is an error tracking tool that helps developers monitor and fix crashes in real-time. The `trace_id` is a unique identifier used by Sentry to track the flow of a request across different services, making it easier to debug issues by correlating logs and errors across your distributed system. Integrating Sentry's `trace_id` within MorningAI allows developers to effectively trace, monitor, and debug the autonomous agent system, documentation management, and task orchestration.

## Understanding `trace_id`

The `trace_id` is part of Sentry's tracing feature, which provides insights into the performance of your application and tracks errors more efficiently. When integrated into MorningAI, each task or request handled by the platform can be monitored from start to end, allowing developers to pinpoint where errors occur or performance bottlenecks arise.

## How to Test Sentry `trace_id` in MorningAI

### Configuration

Before testing, ensure Sentry is correctly set up in your MorningAI project:
1. Add Sentry DSN (Data Source Name) to your project's environment variables.
2. Ensure Sentry SDK is installed and configured in the Flask application (`backend/app.py`).

```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.flask import FlaskIntegration

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="your_sentry_dsn_here",
    integrations=[FlaskIntegration()],
    traces_sample_rate=1.0 # Adjust sampling rate as needed
)
```

### Generating and Testing `trace_id`

To test the `trace_id`, you can simulate an error or use a logging statement within a part of your codebase where you want to track performance or issues.

```python
from flask import Flask, request
from sentry_sdk import capture_message

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/simulate-error')
def simulate_error():
    try:
        # Simulated error for testing
        1 / 0
    except Exception as e:
        capture_message("Simulating error for Sentry trace_id", level='error')
        return {"message": "Error simulated", "trace_id": request.headers.get('sentry-trace')}

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()
```

This example endpoint `/simulate-error` will intentionally cause an error, capturing it along with the `trace_id`. You can then locate this event in your Sentry dashboard using the provided `trace_id`.

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

- **Missing `trace_id`**: Ensure that Sentry SDK is properly initialized and that you are capturing errors or messages after initialization.
- **Errors not appearing in Sentry**: Check if the DSN is correctly configured and if there are any network issues preventing data from being sent.
- **High volume of events**: Adjust the `traces_sample_rate` to a lower value if you're experiencing too many events being sent to Sentry, which could lead to exceeding your quota.

Remember, integrating and testing Sentry's tracing features like `trace_id` within MorningAI not only helps in tracking down errors but also significantly improves the observability of your application's performance.
