# Test Retry Mechanism in MorningAI

Understanding and implementing a test retry mechanism is crucial for maintaining the robustness of your application, especially in a multi-tenant SaaS platform like MorningAI. This FAQ aims to guide developers through the process of setting up and utilizing a retry mechanism for tests within the MorningAI platform, ensuring that transient issues do not lead to false negatives in test results.

## Explanation of the Topic

In software testing, especially in environments with multiple services and integrations like MorningAI, tests can sometimes fail due to transient issues such as network latency, third-party service downtime, or temporary resource unavailability. A test retry mechanism allows these tests to be automatically re-executed a predefined number of times before being marked as failed. This approach helps in distinguishing between genuine bugs and intermittent issues.

MorningAI utilizes a variety of technologies where test retries can be particularly beneficial:

- **Integration Tests**: With components like Redis Queue (RQ) for task orchestration and pgvector/Supabase for vector memory storage, network or service hiccups could cause temporary failures.
- **End-to-End Tests**: Given the multi-platform integration (Telegram, LINE, Messenger), tests involving these external services may occasionally encounter issues outside our control.

### Code Examples

Here's a basic example of implementing a retry mechanism in Python tests using `pytest` (assuming pytest is part of your testing framework):

```python
# Install pytest-rerunfailures plugin
# pip install pytest-rerunfailures

import pytest

@pytest.mark.flaky(reruns=5, reruns_delay=2)
def test_example():
    # Your test code here
    assert potentially_flaky_operation()
```

In this example, `potentially_flaky_operation()` is a placeholder for an operation that might intermittently fail. The `@pytest.mark.flaky` decorator is used to specify that the test should be rerun up to 5 times with a delay of 2 seconds between each attempt if it fails.

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

1. **Ensure Dependencies Are Correct**: Make sure all dependencies, especially those related to testing frameworks and plugins like `pytest-rerunfailures`, are correctly installed and up-to-date.
   
2. **Network Stability**: Transient network issues are common causes of flaky tests. Ensure your testing environment has stable network connectivity, especially when dealing with external services.
   
3. **Service Availability**: Before initiating tests, verify that all external services (e.g., Telegram, LINE, Messenger) and internal services like Redis Queue and Supabase are operational.
   
4. **Configuration Issues**: Double-check your test configurations, including environment variables and any service credentials needed for integration tests.

5. **Review Logs**: If a test fails even after retries, review the logs carefully for any hints about what went wrong. Sometimes the issue may be with how the test is written rather than an issue with the service itself.

By following these guidelines and employing a retry mechanism for your tests within MorningAI's infrastructure, you can significantly reduce the impact of transient issues on your CI/CD pipeline's reliability and improve overall confidence in your build's stability.
