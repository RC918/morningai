# Testing Sentry `trace_id` in MorningAI

This FAQ entry is designed to guide developers through the process of testing and verifying the `trace_id` functionality within the MorningAI platform, utilizing Sentry for error tracking and performance monitoring. Sentry's `trace_id` is crucial for correlating performance issues and errors across services in distributed systems.

## Understanding `trace_id`

The `trace_id` in Sentry is a unique identifier used to track a single request or transaction across multiple systems, services, or microservices. This enables developers to trace the path of a request or transaction through various components of an application, making it easier to diagnose and debug issues.

### How `trace_id` Works in MorningAI

In MorningAI, each task or request handled by the autonomous agent system, documentation management, or any interaction with multi-platform integration might generate logs and potential errors. The integration with Sentry allows these incidents to be tracked using a `trace_id`, linking them back to the specific task or action that caused them.

## Code Examples

To test and use the `trace_id` feature within MorningAI, follow these general steps:

### 1. Integrating Sentry with MorningAI

Ensure Sentry is integrated into your Flask application in MorningAI. This usually involves initializing Sentry with your DSN (Data Source Name) in your app configuration.

```python
# Example: Initializing Sentry in Flask app
from flask import Flask
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.flask import FlaskIntegration

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="your_sentry_dsn_here",
    integrations=[FlaskIntegration()]
)

app = Flask(__name__)
```

### 2. Generating and Logging `trace_id`

When handling requests or tasks that you want to monitor, ensure that you're capturing and logging the `trace_id`. Sentry automatically attaches this ID to errors and performance data, but you can also manually log it for more granular tracking.

```python
from sentry_sdk import Hub

def my_function():
    # Your function logic here
    try:
        # Potentially problematic code here
    except Exception as e:
        trace_id = Hub.current.trace_id
        print(f"Error occurred with trace_id: {trace_id}")
        raise e
```

### 3. Testing with Mock Data

For testing purposes, simulate requests or tasks within your development environment and monitor how `trace_id`s are generated and logged in Sentry's dashboard.

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

- **Missing Trace IDs**: Ensure that Sentry is correctly initialized and integrated with your Flask application. Missing or incorrect DSN configurations can lead to missing data.
- **Incorrectly Captured Transactions**: Verify that your routes or tasks are properly wrapped or monitored by Sentry's middleware or SDK hooks.
- **Performance Overhead**: While useful, excessive logging and tracing can introduce performance overhead. Ensure you're only tracking what's necessary.
