# System Architecture of MorningAI

MorningAI is designed as a multi-tenant Software as a Service (SaaS) platform, leveraging a modern technology stack and architectural patterns to deliver high-performance, scalable, and reliable service. The architecture is built around a core set of services and technologies including React, Flask, PostgreSQL (with Supabase), Redis Queue (RQ), LangGraph, and OpenAI's GPT-4. Below is an overview of the system architecture, aimed at helping developers understand and effectively use MorningAI.

## Frontend

The frontend is developed using React along with Vite for fast builds and TailwindCSS for styling. The choice of React allows for a component-based architecture, making the UI highly reusable and maintainable.

**Code Example: Initializing a React Component**

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import 'tailwindcss/tailwind.css';

function App() {
  return <div className="app">Welcome to MorningAI</div>;
}

export default App;
```

## Backend

The backend is powered by Flask, a micro web framework written in Python. It's designed to be easy to use and scale, with Gunicorn serving as the WSGI HTTP Server to handle requests with multi-worker support for concurrency.

**Code Example: Basic Flask Application**

```python
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello, World!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

Gunicorn Configuration in `gunicorn_config.py`:

```python
workers = 2
threads = 4
timeout = 120
```

## Database

MorningAI utilizes PostgreSQL for its database needs, enhanced with Supabase for additional functionalities like Row Level Security (RLS), real-time updates, and easy integration. This setup ensures data integrity and security while providing flexible query capabilities.

**Example: Connecting to PostgreSQL with Supabase**

To connect to the database via Supabase:

```python
import supabase_py

url: str = "your_supabase_url"
key: str = "your_supabase_key"
supabase = supabase_py.create_client(url, key)
```

## Queue Management

Task management is handled by Redis Queue (RQ), which allows for asynchronous task execution. This is critical for operations that are time-consuming or need to be scheduled independently of user requests.

**Code Example: Enqueueing a Task with RQ**

```python
from redis import Redis
from rq import Queue

redis_conn = Redis()
q = Queue(connection=redis_conn)

result = q.enqueue('my_module.my_function', arg1, arg2)
```

## Orchestration & AI

LangGraph is used for orchestrating complex workflows within the platform, ensuring tasks are performed efficiently in sequence or parallel as required. For AI-powered features like autonomous code generation and FAQ content creation, MorningAI leverages OpenAI's GPT-4.

**Example: Integrating GPT-4 for Content Generation**

Integration specifics may vary based on the API version and specific requirements.

## Deployment

Deployment is managed via Render.com with continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD), streamlining the process of bringing updates live.

## Troubleshooting Tips

- **Frontend Issues:** Ensure dependencies are up-to-date and compatible. Check browser console for errors.
- **Backend Connectivity:** Verify environment variables are correctly set for database connections and external services.
- **Database Permissions:** Ensure RLS policies are correctly configured in Supabase if encountering access issues.
- **Queue Delays:** Monitor the Redis server health and worker logs if tasks are not being processed as expected.
- **Deployment Failures:** Review Render.com deployment logs for specific error messages pointing to configuration or resource issues.

This overview provides a foundational understanding of the MorningAI system architecture. Developers should refer to specific sections of the documentation linked above for detailed guidance on working within each component of the platform.
