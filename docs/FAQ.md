# Handling Redis Outage in MorningAI

Redis plays a crucial role in MorningAI's real-time task orchestration and queue management. An outage can significantly impact the platform's functionality, including task scheduling, execution, and the overall performance of the autonomous agent system. This section provides insights into how developers can understand and mitigate issues during a Redis outage.

## Understanding the Impact of a Redis Outage

When Redis becomes unavailable, several components of MorningAI may be affected:
- **Task Queuing:** The Redis Queue (RQ) is directly impacted, halting the enqueuing and processing of tasks.
- **Real-Time Orchestration:** Task orchestration relies on Redis for managing worker states and scheduling; an outage disrupts this process.
- **Session Management:** If Redis is used for session storage or caching, user sessions might not persist across requests.

## Mitigation Strategies

### 1. Failover Configuration
Ensure that your Redis deployment is configured for high availability (HA). Use Redis Sentinel for automatic failover or set up a Redis Cluster to distribute data across multiple nodes.

**Example:**

```python
from redis import Redis
from rq import Queue
import os

redis_host = os.getenv("REDIS_HOST", "localhost")
redis_port = os.getenv("REDIS_PORT", 6379)
redis_password = os.getenv("REDIS_PASSWORD", None)

try:
    redis_conn = Redis(host=redis_host, port=redis_port, password=redis_password, db=0, socket_timeout=5)
    queue = Queue(connection=redis_conn)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Failed to connect to Redis: {e}")
```

### 2. Implementing Retry Logic
Incorporate retry logic in your application to handle temporary connectivity issues with Redis. Utilize exponential backoff strategies to reduce load on the system while trying to reconnect.

**Example:**

```python
import time
from redis.exceptions import ConnectionError

def connect_with_retry(redis_conn, max_retries=5):
    attempt = 0
    while attempt < max_retries:
        try:
            redis_conn.ping()
            print("Redis connection successful.")
            return True
        except ConnectionError:
            wait = 2 ** attempt
            print(f"Connection failed. Retrying in {wait} seconds...")
            time.sleep(wait)
            attempt += 1
    return False
```

### 3. Monitoring and Alerts
Implement monitoring tools like Prometheus or use managed service monitors to track the health of your Redis instances. Set up alerts for early detection of outages or performance degradations.

## Troubleshooting Tips

- **Verify Connectivity:** Ensure that your application can reach the Redis server. Check network ACLs, firewalls, and security groups.
- **Check Redis Logs:** Review the logs for any errors or warnings that could indicate why the service is down.
- **Resource Utilization:** Monitor CPU and memory usage on the Redis server; high utilization could lead to performance issues or crashes.
- **Backup and Recovery:** Regularly backup your Redis data. In case of corruption or other failures, having backups will allow you to restore service quickly.
