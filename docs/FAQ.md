# Test Retry Mechanism in MorningAI

When working with MorningAI, understanding and implementing a robust test retry mechanism is crucial for ensuring the reliability of your codebase, especially in an environment where tasks can fail due to transient issues. This FAQ entry covers how to use and configure the test retry feature within the MorningAI platform, providing developers with the tools needed to enhance test reliability.

## Understanding Test Retry Mechanism

The test retry mechanism in MorningAI is designed to automatically rerun failed tests before marking them as failures. This is particularly useful for handling flaky tests or transient errors that might occur due to external dependencies, network latency, or other unpredictable factors.

### Configuration

To configure the test retry mechanism, you'll need to modify your test configuration settings. This involves setting up retry policies including the maximum number of retries and defining specific conditions under which a test should be retried.

Example configuration (Python pytest):

```python
# In pytest.ini or conftest.py
def pytest_configure(config):
    config.addinivalue_line("reruns", 2)
    config.addinivalue_line("reruns_delay", 1)  # Delay in seconds between retries
```

This example uses the `pytest-rerunfailures` plugin to add retry logic to pytest. It specifies that tests should be retried up to 2 times with a delay of 1 second between retries.

### Implementing Test Retry Logic

For scenarios where more granular control is required, such as when certain errors should trigger a retry, custom logic can be implemented within your test framework. 

Example custom retry logic in Python:

```python
import pytest
from my_module import transient_error_prone_function

@pytest.mark.flaky(reruns=5, reruns_delay=2)
def test_example():
    assert transient_error_prone_function()
```

This example marks a specific test as flaky using the `@pytest.mark.flaky` decorator from the `pytest-rerunfailures` plugin, allowing it to be retried up to 5 times with a delay of 2 seconds if it fails.

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

- **Tests Not Retrying**: Ensure that your testing framework is correctly configured for retries and that you have the necessary plugins (like `pytest-rerunfailures`) installed.
- **Retry Delays Not Working**: Verify that you've set an appropriate delay between retries and that your testing framework supports this feature.
- **Excessive Retries Leading to Longer Test Times**: Balance the number of retries with the average time tests take to run and consider increasing timeouts for specific tests known to take longer.

Remember, while test retries can help mitigate the impact of flaky tests, they are not a substitute for fixing underlying issues causing test instability. Regularly review failed tests even if they eventually pass after retries.
