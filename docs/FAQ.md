# Testing Sentry Trace ID in MorningAI

## Overview

When integrating Sentry into MorningAI, it's crucial to ensure that the trace IDs are correctly generated and sent to Sentry for effective error tracking and performance monitoring. The trace ID is a unique identifier for each request or transaction, allowing developers to track and diagnose issues across the system easily. This section provides guidance on how to test and validate the Sentry trace ID within the MorningAI platform.

## Generating and Validating Trace ID

To generate and validate a Sentry trace ID in MorningAI, follow these steps:

### 1. Configuration

Ensure Sentry is correctly configured in your project. In the `RC918/morningai` repository, check the Sentry configuration within your Flask application setup in `app/__init__.py`.

Example configuration snippet:

```python
from sentry_sdk import init
from sentry_sdk.integrations.flask import FlaskIntegration

sentry_dsn = 'YOUR_SENTRY_DSN_HERE'

init(
    dsn=sentry_dsn,
    integrations=[FlaskIntegration()],
    traces_sample_rate=1.0  # Adjust sampling rate as needed
)
```

Replace `'YOUR_SENTRY_DSN_HERE'` with your actual Sentry DSN.

### 2. Triggering an Event

Trigger an event or request that you know will generate a trace ID. This could be any transaction within your application that you want to monitor.

Example Flask route that might generate an error:

```python
@app.route('/trigger_error')
def trigger_error():
    division_by_zero = 1 / 0  # This will cause a ZeroDivisionError
    return "This should not be seen."
```

### 3. Locating the Trace ID

After triggering the event, go to your Sentry dashboard. Locate the error or transaction you've generated; the trace ID should be visible in the event's details page.

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

- **Trace ID not appearing**: Ensure that your sampling rate (`traces_sample_rate`) is correctly set to capture enough data. A rate of `1.0` captures all transactions, which is useful for testing.
- **Incorrect Sentry DSN**: Validate that your Sentry DSN is correct and properly set in your Flask app configuration.
- **Sentry SDK not initialized early**: Make sure the Sentry SDK is initialized as early as possible in your application startup code to capture all potential issues.
- **Network issues**: Sometimes, network problems can prevent data from being sent to Sentry. Check your network connections and firewall settings if you suspect this might be the case.
