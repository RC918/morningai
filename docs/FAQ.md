# MorningAI System Architecture

MorningAI leverages a modern, scalable architecture designed to facilitate rapid development and deployment of autonomous agent systems, FAQ generation, documentation management, and multi-platform integration. Below is an in-depth overview of the MorningAI system architecture, focusing on its key components and how they interact within the ecosystem.

## Overview

The MorningAI platform is built upon a robust stack that includes:

- **Frontend**: Developed with React, Vite, and TailwindCSS for a responsive and efficient user interface.
- **Backend**: Utilizes Python with Flask and Gunicorn for handling API requests, serving content dynamically, and managing background tasks with multi-worker support.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for data storage, enhanced with Row Level Security (RLS) for data protection. The platform uses Supabase as a backend service to simplify database management.
- **Queue System**: Redis Queue (RQ) is employed for task queuing to efficiently manage background processes and real-time task execution.
- **Orchestration**: LangGraph is used for orchestrating agent workflows, ensuring smooth operation and task distribution among autonomous agents.
- **AI**: Integrates OpenAI's GPT-4 for advanced content generation capabilities, including FAQ generation.
- **Deployment**: Hosted on Render.com with continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) to streamline updates and deployments.

## Detailed Architecture

### Frontend

The frontend is built using React to create a dynamic single-page application (SPA). It utilizes Vite for bundling and TailwindCSS for styling. This combination allows for rapid UI development with efficient loading times.

```javascript
// Example of creating a simple component in React with TailwindCSS
import React from 'react';

function WelcomeBanner() {
  return <div className="bg-blue-500 text-white p-4">Welcome to MorningAI</div>;
}

export default WelcomeBanner;
```

### Backend

The backend is powered by Flask, a lightweight WSGI web application framework in Python. It's configured to run with Gunicorn as the WSGI HTTP Server to handle requests concurrently across multiple workers.

```python
# Example Flask application setup
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello, World from MorningAI!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

### Database

PostgreSQL is used as the primary data storage mechanism. Supabase adds an additional layer of functionality by providing row-level security (RLS), real-time updates, and an easy-to-use interface for database management.

```sql
-- Example PostgreSQL query with RLS
CREATE TABLE documents (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    content TEXT,
    user_id INTEGER,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id)
);

ALTER TABLE documents ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

### Queue System

Redis Queue (RQ) manages background tasks such as sending asynchronous notifications or processing heavy computations outside the request/response cycle.

```python
# Example of enqueuing a task with Redis Queue in Flask
from rq import Queue
from redis import Redis
from my_module import count_words_at_url

redis_conn = Redis()
q = Queue(connection=redis_conn)

result = q.enqueue(count_words_at_url, 'http://example.com')
```

### Orchestration & AI

LangGraph orchestrates the workflow between different services and agents within the platform. OpenAI's GPT-4 is integrated for generating intelligent responses and content.

### Deployment

Deployed on Render.com with CI/CD pipelines set up for automatic testing and deployment. This ensures that any commits made to the repository are automatically deployed to production after passing all tests.

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

1. **Frontend not updating after deployment**: Ensure that the build process completes successfully on Render.com. Check build logs for any errors.
2. **Database connection issues**: Verify that your Supabase credentials are correct and that your IP address is allowed if using IP whitelisting.
3. **Tasks not processing in RQ**: Make sure Redis is running and accessible. Check your RQ dashboard for failed jobs.
4. **Gunicorn worker timeouts**: If experiencing timeouts with Gunicorn workers, consider increasing the timeout configuration or scaling your service to handle more concurrent requests.
