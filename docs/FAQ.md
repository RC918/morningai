# Handling Redis Outage in MorningAI

When using MorningAI, especially for real-time task orchestration and queue management, Redis plays a crucial role. However, like any other component of a distributed system, it's prone to outages or downtime. Understanding how to handle such scenarios is vital for maintaining the stability and reliability of your services.

## Understanding the Impact

A Redis outage can affect various parts of MorningAI, including:
- **Task Orchestration**: Delay in processing tasks due to inability to enqueue/dequeue tasks.
- **Session Management**: Issues with user sessions if they are managed through Redis.
- **Cache**: Performance degradation due to lack of access to cached data.

## Preparation and Monitoring

Before diving into troubleshooting steps, ensure you have monitoring in place. Tools like Prometheus or Sentry can help detect and alert you about such issues early on.

```python
# Example Sentry configuration snippet for Flask application
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.flask import FlaskIntegration

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="your_sentry_dsn_here",
    integrations=[FlaskIntegration()],
)
```

Ensure your monitoring setup is configured to track the health and performance of your Redis instance(s).

## Troubleshooting Steps

### 1. Verify the Status of Redis

First, check if the Redis service is running:

```bash
redis-cli ping
```

If you receive a `PONG`, then Redis is running. If not, or if there's an error connecting, proceed to restart the service:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart redis.service
```

### 2. Check Network Connectivity

Ensure that there are no network issues between your application servers and the Redis server. Use tools like `ping` or `traceroute` to verify connectivity.

```bash
ping <redis_server_ip>
```

### 3. Review Redis Logs

Check the logs for any errors or warnings that might indicate what caused the outage.

```bash
tail -f /var/log/redis/redis-server.log
```

### 4. Failover Mechanism

If you're using Redis in a cluster setup, ensure that your failover mechanism is working as expected. This might involve checking your Sentinel configuration or ensuring that your client library supports automatic failover.

### 5. Contact Support

If you're using a managed Redis service (e.g., AWS ElastiCache, Google Cloud Memorystore), check the service's status page and contact support for assistance if necessary.

## Preventing Future Outages

- **Regular Maintenance**: Keep your Redis instances updated and monitor their health regularly.
- **High Availability Setup**: Consider setting up a Redis cluster with replication and automatic failover.
- **Backup Strategy**: Regular backups can help recover from data loss incidents related to outages.

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

- Ensure your firewall rules allow traffic on the port Redis uses (default is 6379).
- Verify that there's enough memory available on the server hosting Redis; memory issues are common causes of performance problems or crashes.
- If using Docker or Kubernetes, check container/pod status and logs for any clues.
- For persistent issues, consider enabling AOF (Append Only File) persistence in Redis configuration for more detailed debugging information.

Remember, handling a Redis outage efficiently requires preparation, quick diagnosis, and sometimes improvisation based on your specific setup and requirements.
