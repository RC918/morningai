# Handling Redis Outage in MorningAI

When MorningAI experiences a Redis outage, it can disrupt the platform's real-time task orchestration capabilities, affecting queue management and worker heartbeat monitoring. This FAQ aims to guide developers through understanding the impact of a Redis outage on MorningAI and provides steps to mitigate and resolve issues that may arise.

## Understanding the Impact of a Redis Outage

Redis, utilized by MorningAI for queue management via Redis Queue (RQ) and for worker heartbeat monitoring, plays a critical role in managing asynchronous tasks and ensuring smooth operation of distributed workers. An outage can result in:

- Inability to enqueue new tasks.
- Failure in executing scheduled tasks.
- Disruption in the monitoring of worker heartbeats, potentially leading to unnoticed worker failures.

## Mitigation Steps

### 1. Immediate Actions During an Outage

During an outage, it's essential to prevent task loss and system failures:

```python
# Example: Graceful handling of Redis connection issues in task producer
import redis
from rq import Queue
from your_task_module import your_task_function

redis_url = "redis://localhost:6379"
try:
    r = redis.Redis.from_url(redis_url)
    q = Queue(connection=r)
    job = q.enqueue(your_task_function, arg1, arg2)
except redis.exceptions.RedisError as e:
    # Implement your fallback logic here
    print(f"Failed to enqueue task due to Redis error: {e}")
```

### 2. Monitoring and Alerts

Ensure you have monitoring and alerts set up for your Redis instance. This allows you to respond quickly to outages.

### 3. Fallback Mechanisms

Consider implementing fallback mechanisms or alternative queues that can temporarily hold tasks until Redis is back online.

## Post-Outage Recovery

Once Redis is back online, ensure that all tasks enqueued during the outage are processed according to their priority. It might be necessary to manually requeue some tasks or adjust priorities based on the time they were offline.

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

- **Connection Issues**: Verify your network connection and ensure that the Redis server is running.
- **Data Persistence**: Check your Redis configuration for data persistence settings to avoid data loss during unexpected shutdowns.
- **Worker Monitoring**: Investigate logs for any anomalies in worker behavior pre-and post-outage.
- **Resource Limits**: Ensure that Redis is not hitting memory limits or other resource constraints that could lead to performance issues.
