# MorningAI System Architecture

MorningAI leverages a robust and scalable architecture designed to efficiently handle real-time task orchestration, autonomous code generation, FAQ documentation management, and multi-platform integration. This architecture ensures high performance, reliability, and seamless scalability to meet the needs of modern software development teams and projects.

## Overview

The system architecture is built on a microservices-oriented approach, utilizing a combination of state-of-the-art technologies and frameworks. Below is a comprehensive breakdown of the key components and their roles within the MorningAI platform:

### Frontend

- **Technology Stack**: The frontend is developed using React for building user interfaces with Vite as the build tool for a fast development experience and TailwindCSS for styling.
- **Code Example**:
  ```jsx
  import React from 'react';
  import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
  import './index.css'; // Tailwind utility classes
  import App from './App';

  ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
  ```

### Backend

- **Technology Stack**: The backend services are built with Python using the Flask framework. Gunicorn serves as the WSGI HTTP Server to manage multiple workers for handling requests.
- **Code Example**:
  ```python
  from flask import Flask
  app = Flask(__name__)

  @app.route('/')
  def hello_world():
      return 'Hello, World!'
  
  if __name__ == '__main__':
      app.run()
  ```

### Database

- **Technology**: PostgreSQL is used for data storage, enhanced with Row Level Security (RLS) features. Supabase adds real-time capabilities and additional tools to streamline database management.
- **Setup Instructions**:
  To integrate PostgreSQL with Supabase, navigate to your Supabase project dashboard, create a new table or use SQL queries directly in the SQL editor provided by Supabase.

### Queue

- **Technology**: Redis Queue (RQ) is utilized for managing background tasks and worker processes. It's integrated with heartbeat monitoring to ensure worker health.
- **Code Example**:
  ```python
  from rq import Queue
  from redis import Redis
  redis_conn = Redis()
  q = Queue(connection=redis_conn)

  def background_task():
      print("Task running")
  
  job = q.enqueue(background_task)
  ```

### Orchestration

- **Technology**: LangGraph is used for defining and executing agent workflows, ensuring tasks are processed efficiently across different components of the system.
  
### AI

- **Technology**: OpenAI's GPT-4 powers content generation capabilities within MorningAI, including code generation and FAQ documentation creation.

### Deployment

- **Platform**: Render.com is used for hosting both frontend and backend services with continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines set up for automatic updates.

## Troubleshooting Tips

1. **Deployment Issues**: Ensure that all environment variables are correctly set up in Render.com settings. Check the service logs for any errors during the build or deployment process.
2. **Database Connectivity**: Verify that your PostgreSQL credentials are accurate in your application configuration. Ensure that network access settings in Supabase allow connections from your application's IP address.
3. **Redis Queue Worker Failures**: Monitor worker health through RQ Dashboard. If workers are frequently dying, investigate memory usage or task execution times as potential issues.
