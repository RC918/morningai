# Testing Sentry Trace ID in MorningAI

## Introduction
In MorningAI, integrating Sentry for error tracking and performance monitoring is crucial for maintaining the reliability and efficiency of the platform. A key feature of Sentry's integration is the use of `trace_id`, which helps in tracing errors and performance issues back to their origins across different services and requests. This FAQ aims to guide developers on how to test and utilize Sentry `trace_id` within the MorningAI platform.

## Understanding Trace ID
A `trace_id` is a unique identifier assigned to every request or transaction that flows through the system. It is used to correlate events, logs, and errors across services. In the context of MorningAI, `trace_id` allows developers to track the flow of requests across its microservices architecture, making debugging and performance monitoring significantly more manageable.

### How Trace ID Works with Sentry
When an error or performance issue occurs, Sentry captures it along with the `trace_id`. This ID can then be used to trace back through logs and events to understand the issue's context and how it propagated through the system.

## Code Example: Generating and Using Trace ID

To test Sentry `trace_id` in MorningAI, you can follow these steps:

1. **Ensure Sentry is Configured in Your Service**: Before generating a trace ID, make sure Sentry SDK is set up correctly in your service. Here's an example setup in a Flask application:

```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.flask import FlaskIntegration

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="your_sentry_dsn_here",
    integrations=[FlaskIntegration()],
    traces_sample_rate=1.0  # Adjust sampling rate as needed
)
```

2. **Generate and Use a Trace ID**: When handling a request that you want to track, you can generate a trace ID as follows:

```python
from sentry_sdk import Hub

def handle_request():
    trace_id = Hub.current.trace_id
    print(f"Handling request with trace ID: {trace_id}")
    # Proceed with handling the request
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to retrieve the current `trace_id` associated with a request being handled by your service.

3. **Logging and Error Reporting**: To log or report errors with the trace ID, use Sentry's context setting functions:

```python
from sentry_sdk import set_context

set_context("Trace Info", {"trace_id": Hub.current.trace_id})
```

By attaching the `trace_id` to errors or messages, you enhance your ability to debug issues by correlating them across different parts of your application or services.

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

- **Trace ID Not Generated**: Ensure that the Sentry SDK is initialized early in your application startup sequence and that you have correctly configured your DSN (Data Source Name).
- **Low Visibility into Traces**: If you're not seeing enough detail in traces, consider adjusting your `traces_sample_rate` to capture more or fewer transactions based on your needs.
- **Performance Overhead**: Be mindful of the potential performance impact of logging too many traces or setting a high sample rate for transactions. Monitor your application's performance and adjust as necessary.

Remember, effectively using `trace_id` with Sentry in MorningAI can significantly improve your ability to monitor, debug, and optimize your application.
