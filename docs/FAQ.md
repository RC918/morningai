# Testing Sentry Trace ID in MorningAI

When integrating or debugging applications with Sentry in the MorningAI platform, understanding how to test and use the `trace_id` is crucial for effective monitoring and issue resolution. The `trace_id` is a unique identifier for each request or operation, allowing developers to trace events, errors, and performance issues back to their source. This guide will help you understand how to test and utilize the `trace_id` within the MorningAI environment.

## Understanding Trace ID

In Sentry, a `trace_id` is part of its distributed tracing system, which helps in tracking the performance and reliability of requests as they flow through different services and components. By leveraging `trace_id`, developers can pinpoint failures or bottlenecks within complex systems.

## How to Test Sentry Trace ID

To test Sentry's `trace_id` functionality within MorningAI, follow these steps:

### 1. Configuration

Ensure Sentry is correctly configured in your application. In your Flask app (typically found in `app/__init__.py` or a similar location), make sure you initialize Sentry SDK with your DSN (Data Source Name):

```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.flask import FlaskIntegration

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="your_sentry_dsn_here",
    integrations=[FlaskIntegration()],
    traces_sample_rate=1.0 # Adjust sampling rate as needed
)
```

### 2. Generating and Retrieving `trace_id`

Whenever an error occurs or a request is made, Sentry automatically assigns a `trace_id`. You can retrieve and log this ID by modifying error handlers or middleware in your Flask application:

```python
@app.errorhandler(Exception)
def handle_exception(e):
    # Log exception information including trace_id
    trace_id = sentry_sdk.last_event_id()
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}, Sentry trace ID: {trace_id}")
    return "An internal error occurred.", 500
```

For tracing successful requests or specific operations, consider manually capturing messages:

```python
with sentry_sdk.push_scope() as scope:
    # This block could wrap around any code section you wish to monitor
    sentry_sdk.capture_message("Testing trace", level="info")
    trace_id = scope._last_event_id  # Retrieve the trace ID for logging or debugging purposes.
    print(f"Sentry trace ID: {trace_id}")
```

### 3. Viewing Traces in Sentry

Once you have captured and logged the `trace_id`, visit your Sentry dashboard. Here, you can search for the specific `trace_id` to view related events, performance metrics, and any associated errors or transactions.

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

- **Trace ID Not Generated**: Ensure that your Sentry SDK initialization is correct and that the DSN matches what's provided in your Sentry project settings.
- **Sampling Rate Issues**: If you're not seeing all expected traces, check your `traces_sample_rate`. A lower value means fewer transactions will be captured.
- **Missing Errors or Transactions**: Verify that there are no uncaught exceptions before transactions are sent and that your network configurations allow outgoing requests to Sentry's servers.

By following this guide, you should be able to effectively test and utilize the `trace_id` feature within MorningAI's integration with Sentry, aiding in efficient debugging and application monitoring.
