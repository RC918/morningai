# System Architecture of MorningAI

The MorningAI platform is designed as a multi-tenant SaaS (Software as a Service) offering that leverages modern technologies to provide an autonomous agent system for code generation, FAQ generation, documentation management, multi-platform integration, real-time task orchestration, and vector memory storage. This document provides a comprehensive overview of the system architecture implemented in the MorningAI platform.

## Overview

MorningAI's architecture is built to be scalable, resilient, and efficient, ensuring that it can handle the demands of code and content generation across multiple tenants simultaneously. The key components of the architecture include:

- **Frontend:** Developed with React, utilizing Vite for build optimization and TailwindCSS for styling.
- **Backend:** Powered by Python with Flask serving as the web framework and Gunicorn as the WSGI HTTP server with multi-worker support for handling concurrent requests.
- **Database:** Utilizes PostgreSQL for storage with Supabase as the backend service, which adds additional features such as real-time subscriptions and Row Level Security (RLS) for data protection.
- **Queue:** Redis Queue (RQ) is used for managing background tasks and real-time task orchestration, with worker heartbeat monitoring to ensure reliability.
- **Orchestration:** LangGraph is employed for orchestrating agent workflows, enabling sophisticated interaction patterns among autonomous agents.
- **AI:** The AI component is powered by OpenAI GPT-4 for content generation, providing advanced capabilities in understanding and generating human-like text.
- **Deployment:** Hosted on Render.com with continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines to streamline development and deployment processes.

### Code Examples

#### Flask Application Initialization

```python
from flask import Flask
from redis import Redis
from rq import Queue

app = Flask(__name__)
redis_conn = Redis()
task_queue = Queue(connection=redis_conn)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
```

This snippet initializes a Flask application along with Redis and RQ for task queuing.

#### Supabase Integration

To integrate Supabase with your Python backend:

```python
import supabase_py

url: str = "your-supabase-url"
key: str = "your-supabase-key"
supabase = supabase_py.create_client(url, key)
```

Replace `"your-supabase-url"` and `"your-supabase-key"` with your actual Supabase project details.

### Common Troubleshooting Tips

**Issue**: Failed deployments on Render.com  
**Solution**: Ensure that all environment variables are correctly set in the Render dashboard. Check the logs provided by Render for specific error messages.

**Issue**: Tasks not being processed by RQ workers  
**Solution**: Verify that RQ workers are running and connected to the correct Redis instance. Use `rq info` command to inspect the queue status.

**Issue**: Database connection errors  
**Solution**: Confirm that your PostgreSQL database URL and credentials in Supabase are correctly configured in your application's environment variables.
