# MorningAI System Architecture

MorningAI leverages a modern, scalable architecture designed to provide efficient autonomous agent system services, including code generation, FAQ generation, documentation management, and multi-platform integration. Below is an overview of its core components and how they interact within the ecosystem.

## Overview

The MorningAI platform is built on a microservices architecture, utilizing a variety of technologies and frameworks to ensure high performance, reliability, and scalability. The system architecture is divided into several key components:

### Frontend

- **Technology Stack**: The frontend is developed using React for building user interfaces efficiently with Vite as the build tool for a faster and leaner development experience. Styling is handled by TailwindCSS for utility-first CSS.
- **Code Example**: The frontend setup can be found under `/frontend`, with the entry point being `index.js`:
  ```javascript
  import React from 'react';
  import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
  import './index.css';
  import App from './App';

  ReactDOM.render(
    <React.StrictMode>
      <App />
    </React.StrictMode>,
    document.getElementById('root')
  );
  ```

### Backend

- **Technology Stack**: The backend is powered by Python using the Flask framework, with Gunicorn serving as the WSGI HTTP server to handle requests. This setup supports multi-worker configurations for handling high concurrency.
- **Database Integration**: PostgreSQL is utilized for data storage, with Supabase providing additional functionalities like Row Level Security (RLS) for enhanced data protection. pgvector/Supabase supports vector memory storage for efficient data retrieval.
- **Code Example**: A basic Flask application setup in `/backend/app.py` might look like:
  ```python
  from flask import Flask
  app = Flask(__name__)

  @app.route('/')
  def hello_world():
      return 'Hello, World!'
  
  if __name__ == '__main__':
      app.run()
  ```

### Queue System

- **Redis Queue (RQ)**: Used for real-time task orchestration, allowing asynchronous task processing to ensure responsiveness and scalability of the platform.
- **Worker Monitoring**: Includes heartbeat monitoring of workers to detect and manage failed jobs or unresponsive workers efficiently.

### AI and Orchestration

- **AI**: Utilizes OpenAI GPT-4 for generating content dynamically, including FAQ content and code generation tasks.
- **Orchestration**: LangGraph is employed for managing agent workflows effectively across different components of the platform.

### Deployment

- Hosted on Render.com with continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD), ensuring seamless updates and maintenance.

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

1. **Frontend Issues**:
   - Ensure all node modules are installed correctly (`npm install` or `yarn install`).
   - Check for browser console errors that might indicate issues with React components or API calls.

2. **Backend Issues**:
   - Verify that all Python dependencies are installed (`pip install -r requirements.txt`).
   - Ensure the database connection strings are correctly configured in environment variables or configuration files.

3. **Queue/Worker Issues**:
   - Monitor Redis Queue dashboard for failed jobs.
   - Check worker logs for exceptions or errors during task execution.

For any specific issues not covered here or further assistance, please refer to the project's issue tracker on GitHub or contact the maintainers directly.
