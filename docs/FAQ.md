# System Architecture of MorningAI

MorningAI leverages a robust and scalable architecture designed to handle the demands of autonomous agent systems for code generation, comprehensive FAQ and documentation management, and real-time task orchestration. The platform offers seamless multi-platform integration and utilizes advanced technologies to ensure efficient performance and user satisfaction. Below is a detailed overview of the MorningAI system architecture.

## Overview

The system architecture of MorningAI is built around a microservices approach, utilizing various technologies across its frontend, backend, database management, queue management, orchestration, AI capabilities, and deployment strategies. This design facilitates scalability, reliability, and ease of maintenance.

### Frontend

- **Technology Stack**: React, Vite, TailwindCSS
- **Functionality**: Provides an intuitive user interface for interacting with the platform's features. It is developed using React for efficient UI rendering, Vite for fast development and bundling, and TailwindCSS for styling.

### Backend

- **Technology Stack**: Python, Flask, Gunicorn with multi-worker support
- **Functionality**: Serves as the backbone of the platform, handling HTTP requests, executing business logic, managing database operations, and interfacing with other services. Flask is used for its simplicity and flexibility in creating web applications. Gunicorn serves as the WSGI HTTP Server to manage multiple worker processes for handling requests concurrently.

### Database

- **Technology Stack**: PostgreSQL (Supabase) with Row Level Security
- **Functionality**: Stores and manages all data related to users, tasks, documentation, etc., with robust security measures like Row Level Security (RLS) to ensure data isolation across tenants.

### Queue

- **Technology Stack**: Redis Queue (RQ) with worker heartbeat monitoring
- **Functionality**: Manages background jobs and task queues to enable asynchronous task processing. Worker heartbeat monitoring ensures that tasks are being processed reliably.

### Orchestration

- **Technology Stack**: LangGraph for agent workflows
- **Functionality**: Coordinates complex workflows between different services and agents within the platform.

### AI

- **Technology Stack**: OpenAI GPT-4
- **Functionality**: Powers the autonomous code generation and FAQ/documentation content creation with state-of-the-art natural language processing capabilities.

### Deployment

- **Platform**: Render.com with CI/CD
- **Functionality**: Ensures smooth deployment of application updates with continuous integration and continuous delivery pipelines on Render.com.

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

**Issue: Application not responding**

- Check if Gunicorn workers are running correctly.
- Verify Redis Queue workers are alive and processing tasks.
  
**Issue: Database Connection Errors**

- Ensure Supabase credentials are up-to-date in your environment variables.
- Review Row Level Security policies if experiencing unauthorized access errors.

**Issue: Failed Deployments on Render.com**

- Confirm that all required environment variables are correctly set in Render.com settings.
- Check build logs for errors during the CI/CD process.

This architecture ensures that MorningAI remains at the forefront of efficiency and innovation in serving its users' needs for autonomous coding assistance, documentation generation, and task orchestration across various platforms.
