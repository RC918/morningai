Below you'll find detailed explanations, code examples, troubleshooting tips, and links to further documentation.

## Understanding MorningAI

MorningAI is designed to streamline your development workflow by providing an autonomous agent system for code generation, simplifying the process of FAQ generation and documentation management, offering multi-platform integration capabilities (including Telegram, LINE, Messenger), facilitating real-time task orchestration with Redis Queue, and leveraging vector memory storage with pgvector/Supabase.

### Key Features:

- **Autonomous Agent System**: Automates the process of code generation, reducing manual coding efforts.
- **Documentation Management**: Simplifies creating, updating, and managing FAQs and other documentation.
- **Multi-Platform Integration**: Enables your applications to communicate across various messaging platforms seamlessly.
- **Real-Time Task Orchestration**: Utilizes Redis Queue for efficient task management and execution.
- **Vector Memory Storage**: Leverages pgvector/Supabase for optimized data storage solutions.

### Technology Stack:

- **Frontend**: React, Vite, TailwindCSS
- **Backend**: Python, Flask, Gunicorn with multi-worker support
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Supabase) with Row Level Security
- **Queue**: Redis Queue (RQ) with worker heartbeat monitoring
- **Orchestration**: LangGraph for agent workflows
- **AI**: OpenAI GPT-4 for content generation
- **Deployment**: Render.com with CI/CD

## Code Examples

To get started with MorningAI, you might want to set up a basic Flask application that integrates with the platform. Below is an example of how to initialize a Flask application that communicates with MorningAI's backend services.

```python
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/generate-code')
def generate_code():
    # Assuming you have a function to communicate with MorningAI's code generation service
    code = morning_ai.generate_code(prompt="Create a basic Flask app")
    return code

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed:

```shell
pip install flask morningai-sdk
```

**Note:** `morningai-sdk` is a placeholder for the actual SDK name used for interacting with MorningAI services.

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

1. **Connection Issues**: Ensure your network allows connections to MorningAI services. Check firewall settings if necessary.
2. **Dependency Problems**: If you encounter issues related to missing dependencies or incompatible versions, verify that you've installed all required packages as specified in the project's `requirements.txt`.
3. **Database Configuration**: When working with PostgreSQL and Supabase for vector memory storage, ensure that Row Level Security is correctly configured. Incorrect settings may lead to unauthorized access errors or data retrieval issues.
