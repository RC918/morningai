# MorningAI System Architecture

MorningAI leverages a modern, scalable, and highly efficient architecture designed to provide a seamless experience in generating autonomous agent systems for code generation, FAQ generation, documentation management, and real-time task orchestration. Below is a comprehensive overview of the system architecture, designed to help developers understand and effectively use MorningAI.

## Overview

The MorningAI platform is built on a robust technology stack that includes React, Vite, TailwindCSS for the frontend; Python, Flask, Gunicorn with multi-worker support for the backend; PostgreSQL (Supabase) with Row Level Security for database management; Redis Queue (RQ) for task queuing; LangGraph for agent workflows orchestration; and OpenAI GPT-4 for content generation. The platform is deployed on Render.com with continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) practices.

### Frontend

- **Technologies**: React, Vite, TailwindCSS
- **Functionality**: Provides the user interface for interacting with the platform. It is designed to be responsive and user-friendly.
  
```jsx
// Sample React component
import React from 'react';
import 'tailwindcss/tailwind.css';

function WelcomeMessage() {
  return <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold">Welcome to MorningAI</h1>;
}

export default WelcomeMessage;
```

### Backend

- **Technologies**: Python, Flask, Gunicorn
- **Functionality**: Handles API requests, integrates with the database and external services like OpenAI GPT-4 for content generation, and manages task queues.
  
```python
# Sample Flask application setup
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello from Flask!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

### Database

- **Technology**: PostgreSQL (Supabase) with Row Level Security
- **Functionality**: Stores all platform data securely. Utilizes Supabase for easy scaling and management.

### Queue

- **Technology**: Redis Queue (RQ)
- **Functionality**: Manages background tasks such as code generation or document processing in a scalable way.

```python
# Enqueueing a job in Redis Queue
from redis import Redis
from rq import Queue

q = Queue(connection=Redis())

def background_task():
    print("Running in the background")

job = q.enqueue(background_task)
```

### Orchestration

- **Technology**: LangGraph
- **Functionality**: Orchestrates complex workflows between autonomous agents within the platform.

### AI

- **Technology**: OpenAI GPT-4
- **Functionality**: Powers intelligent content generation including FAQs and documentation.

### Deployment

- **Platform**: Render.com
- **Features**: Offers CI/CD making deployments seamless and automated.

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

1. **Frontend not updating after changes**:
   - Ensure Vite hot module replacement (HMR) is enabled.
   - Check if your browser cache is preventing updates.
   
2. **API requests failing**:
   - Verify Flask server is running and accessible.
   - Check network requests in browser dev tools for error statuses or messages.

3. **Database connection issues**:
   - Confirm PostgreSQL service is running.
   - Ensure correct environment variables are set for Supabase connection strings.

4. **Tasks not processing in RQ**:
   - Ensure Redis server is up and running.
   - Check RQ dashboard or logs for failed jobs or errors.

5. **Deployment failures on Render.com**:
   - Review build logs on Render.com for specific errors.
   - Check your `render.yaml` file for configuration issues.

By understanding MorningAI's system architecture and following these troubleshooting tips, developers can effectively navigate and utilize the platform's capabilities to enhance their projects.
