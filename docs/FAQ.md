# MorningAI System Architecture

The MorningAI platform is designed as a scalable, multi-tenant Software as a Service (SaaS) solution, leveraging modern technologies and architectural patterns to provide robust code generation, FAQ generation, documentation management, and real-time task orchestration capabilities. Below is an overview of the system architecture, highlighting key components and their interactions.

## Overview

MorningAI's architecture is composed of several interconnected services and components, structured to optimize performance, scalability, and maintainability. The main components include:

- **Frontend**: Developed with React and Vite for a responsive user interface, styled with TailwindCSS for a modern look and feel.
- **Backend**: Built on Python with Flask framework, employing Gunicorn as the WSGI HTTP server with multi-worker support to handle concurrent requests efficiently.
- **Database**: Utilizes PostgreSQL for data storage, enhanced with Supabase for additional features like Row Level Security (RLS), providing a secure way to manage data access.
- **Queue System**: Redis Queue (RQ) is used for task queuing to manage background jobs and real-time task orchestration effectively.
- **Orchestration Layer**: Implements LangGraph for defining and managing the workflow of autonomous agents within the platform.
- **AI Engine**: Integrates OpenAI's GPT-4 for advanced content generation capabilities, including FAQ generation and code suggestions.
- **Deployment & CI/CD**: Hosted on Render.com with continuous integration and continuous deployment pipelines to ensure smooth updates and maintenance.

### Frontend Architecture

```javascript
// Example: src/App.jsx
import React from 'react';
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route } from 'react-router-dom';
import HomePage from './pages/HomePage';
import AboutPage from './pages/AboutPage';
// TailwindCSS import for global styles
import './index.css';

function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <div className="app">
        <Route exact path="/" component={HomePage} />
        <Route path="/about" component={AboutPage} />
      </div>
    </Router>
  );
}

export default App;
```

### Backend Architecture

```python
# Example: app.py
from flask import Flask
from flask_restful import Api
from resources.example_resource import ExampleResource

app = Flask(__name__)
api = Api(app)

# Endpoint definition
api.add_resource(ExampleResource, '/api/example')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

### Database Configuration

```sql
-- Example: Enable Row Level Security for a table
ALTER TABLE your_table_name ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

### Queue Configuration

```python
# Example: worker.py
import redis
from rq import Worker, Queue, Connection

listen = ['high', 'default', 'low']

redis_url = 'redis://localhost:6379'

conn = redis.from_url(redis_url)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    with Connection(conn):
        worker = Worker(map(Queue, listen))
        worker.work()
```

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

1. **Frontend not updating**: Ensure that your browser cache is cleared or use hard refresh (Ctrl+F5) after deploying new changes.
2. **Database connection issues**: Verify that the database credentials in your configuration are correct and that your database server is running.
3. **Background tasks not running**: Check that Redis server is up and that RQ workers are running. Use `rq info` command to inspect the queue status.
4. **Deployment failures**: Consult the deployment logs on Render.com for specific errors. Ensure all environment variables are correctly set up.
