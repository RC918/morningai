# System Architecture of MorningAI

MorningAI leverages a modern, scalable, and robust technology stack designed to facilitate autonomous code generation, documentation management, and real-time task orchestration across multiple platforms. Understanding the system architecture is crucial for developers who aim to contribute to, extend, or integrate with MorningAI. This section outlines the components and their interactions within the MorningAI platform.

## Overview

The architecture of MorningAI is built around several core components:

- **Frontend**: Developed with React, utilizing Vite for an optimized build toolchain and TailwindCSS for styling.
- **Backend**: A Python-based backend using Flask as the web framework and Gunicorn as the WSGI HTTP Server with multi-worker support.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for data storage, enhanced with Row Level Security (RLS) features provided by Supabase.
- **Queue System**: Redis Queue (RQ) handles asynchronous task execution, ensuring efficient real-time task management.
- **Orchestration**: LangGraph is employed for orchestrating agent workflows, enabling complex task sequences and dependencies.
- **AI Component**: Utilizes OpenAI's GPT-4 for intelligent content generation including code snippets, documentation, and FAQs.
- **Deployment**: Hosted on Render.com with continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines in place.

## Detailed Components Interaction

### Frontend

```jsx
// Sample component using React and TailwindCSS
const HelloWorld = () => {
  return <div className="text-center p-4 m-4 border rounded shadow-lg">Hello, MorningAI!</div>;
};
```

**Path**: `/src/components/HelloWorld.jsx`

### Backend

Flask app initialization with Gunicorn configuration:

```python
# app.py - Flask application setup
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello, MorningAI Backend!'

# Gunicorn command to run: gunicorn -w 4 app:app
```

**Path**: `/backend/app.py`

### Database Configuration (Supabase/PostgreSQL)

Ensure RLS is enabled for security:

```sql
-- Enable RLS on a table example
ALTER TABLE your_table ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

**Path**: Refer to database migration scripts in `/migrations/`

### Redis Queue (RQ) Setup

Example of enqueuing a job:

```python
from redis import Redis
from rq import Queue

redis_conn = Redis()
q = Queue(connection=redis_conn)

def background_task():
    # Task implementation
    return "Completed"

job = q.enqueue(background_task)
```

**Path**: `/backend/tasks.py`

### LangGraph Orchestration Example

*Note: Specific code examples for LangGraph are proprietary and context-specific. Developers should refer to LangGraph documentation.*

### AI Integration with OpenAI GPT-4

Sample API call to generate text:

```python
import openai

openai.api_key = 'your-api-key'

response = openai.Completion.create(
  engine="text-davinci-003",
  prompt="Generate FAQ content for a SaaS platform",
  temperature=0.7,
  max_tokens=1000,
  top_p=1.0,
  frequency_penalty=0.0,
  presence_penalty=0.0
)

print(response.choices[0].text.strip())
```

**Path**: `/backend/ai_integration.py`

## Troubleshooting Tips

1. **Frontend Issues**: Ensure all npm dependencies are correctly installed (`npm install`). Check browser console for errors.
2. **Backend Connectivity**: Verify that Gunicorn is running and accessible. Ensure Flask routes are correctly defined.
3. **Database Access Errors**: Confirm that Supabase/PostgreSQL credentials are correct and RLS policies do not inadvertently block access.
4. **Redis Queue Jobs Not Running**: Check that Redis server is up and workers are started (`rq worker`).
5. **Deployment Failures on Render.com**: Review build logs on Render.com for specific error messages.

For more detailed information on each component, refer to the official documentation of the respective technologies.
