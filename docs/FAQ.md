# Handling MorningAI During a Redis Outage

When encountering a Redis outage, MorningAI's real-time task orchestration and queue management may be significantly impacted. This FAQ aims to guide developers through understanding the implications of a Redis outage on MorningAI and provides steps to mitigate and resolve issues that may arise.

## Understanding the Impact of a Redis Outage

Redis Queue (RQ) is integral to MorningAI for managing background tasks and orchestrating real-time operations. An outage can halt task processing, affecting autonomous agent system code generation, multi-platform integration message queuing, and real-time task execution.

### Symptoms of a Redis Outage:

- Delayed or failed task executions.
- Timeouts or errors in operations requiring real-time data processing.
- Inaccessible or slow responses from features relying on vector memory storage.

## Mitigation Steps

During an outage, consider the following steps to minimize disruption:

1. **Immediate Notification**: Ensure monitoring tools are in place to alert the development team immediately when an outage is detected.

2. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Implement fallback mechanisms for critical tasks that can't afford downtime. This might involve queuing tasks in an alternative temporary storage or reducing dependency on real-time processing.

3. **Communication with Users**: Inform end-users of potential delays or degraded performance in services relying on Redis.

### Code Example: Fallback Task Queue

Implementing a simple fallback mechanism using Python's in-memory queue as an example:

```python
from queue import Queue
import threading

# Fallback queue if Redis is down
fallback_queue = Queue()

def process_task(task):
    # Placeholder for task processing logic
    print(f"Processing {task}")

def worker():
    while True:
        item = fallback_queue.get()
        if item is None:
            break  # Exit if None is encountered
        process_task(item)
        fallback_queue.task_done()

# Start thread for processing fallback tasks
threading.Thread(target=worker, daemon=True).start()

# Example of adding a task to the fallback queue
fallback_queue.put("Example Task")
```

Note: This is a basic example for illustrative purposes. In production scenarios, consider more robust solutions like alternative distributed queues or databases as fallbacks.

## Recovery Steps Post-Outage

Upon resolving the Redis outage, follow these steps to ensure smooth recovery:

1. **Task Reconciliation**: Ensure that any tasks queued during the outage are re-queued in Redis Queue for processing.

2. **System Health Check**: Perform a comprehensive check of all components relying on Redis to confirm they are functioning correctly.

3. **Review Outage Report**: Analyze the cause of the outage and implement measures to prevent future occurrences, such as infrastructure enhancements or updated monitoring alerts.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Tasks Not Processing**: Confirm that Redis services have fully recovered and that RQ workers are running. Use `rq info` command to inspect worker status and queues.
- **Performance Degradation**: After an outage, there might be a surge in queued tasks causing temporary performance hits. Monitor system resources and scale accordingly.
- **Data Consistency**: Verify data integrity for operations performed during the outage, especially if fallback mechanisms were employed.
