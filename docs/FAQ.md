# Test Retry Success in MorningAI

Understanding and implementing test retries in the MorningAI platform can significantly enhance the reliability and robustness of your testing strategy. This FAQ entry is designed to guide developers through the process of configuring and using test retries within the MorningAI environment.

## Understanding Test Retries

Test retries are a mechanism that allows failed tests to be automatically rerun, which can be crucial for overcoming issues caused by transient conditions such as network latency, temporary service unavailability, or random test failures. Implementing retries can help ensure that your codebase remains stable and reliable without manual intervention for these sporadic issues.

### Configuration

MorningAI leverages pytest for Python-based test execution, which supports test retries through the `pytest-rerunfailures` plugin. To configure test retries, you must first ensure that this plugin is installed and then specify the retry count and optional delay between retries in your pytest configuration.

#### Installing `pytest-rerunfailures`

Ensure you have `pytest` and `pytest-rerunfailures` installed in your environment:

```bash
pip install pytest pytest-rerunfailures
```

#### Configuring Pytest for Retries

In your `pytest.ini`, `.pytest.ini`, `tox.ini`, or `setup.cfg` file within the RC918/morningai repository, add the following lines to enable retries:

```ini
[pytest]
addopts = --reruns 3 --reruns-delay 5
```

This configuration will retry any failed test up to 3 times with a delay of 5 seconds between each retry.

### Code Example

While there's no specific code modification required in your tests for retries to work, here's an example of how you might write a simple test that could benefit from retries:

```python
def test_api_response():
    response = requests.get("https://api.example.com/data")
    assert response.status_code == 200
```

If this API occasionally fails due to network issues, the retry mechanism will automatically rerun the failed test, improving the chances of passing without requiring manual retests.

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

- **Retries not triggering**: Ensure that the `pytest-rerunfailures` plugin is correctly installed and configured in your project settings.
- **Tests failing even after retries**: Investigate if the issue is not transient and requires a fix in your codebase or environment setup.
- **Performance impact**: Be mindful of the impact on CI/CD pipeline execution time due to added retry delays and potentially running tests multiple times.

Remember, while test retries can help mitigate flaky tests' impact, they are not a substitute for fixing underlying issues causing consistent failures.
