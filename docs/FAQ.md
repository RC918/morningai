# How to Implement Test Retry for Success in MorningAI

Implementing test retries is an essential feature in software development, ensuring that transient issues or flakiness in tests can be overcome without manual intervention. This guide will help developers understand and use the test retry mechanism within the MorningAI platform, focusing on achieving higher stability and reliability in automated testing.

## Understanding Test Retries

Test retries allow a test that fails initially to be automatically re-executed a specific number of times before being marked as a failure. This approach is particularly useful for addressing non-deterministic failures that can occur due to external dependencies, network latency, or other intermittent issues.

### Configuration

To implement test retries within the MorningAI platform, you will typically modify your test framework's configuration or utilize the built-in retry mechanisms provided by your testing library. For demonstration purposes, we'll use Pytest with its `pytest-rerunfailures` plugin, which is compatible with our backend stack (Python/Flask).

1. **Installing pytest-rerunfailures**

   First, ensure you have the `pytest-rerunfailures` plugin installed:

   ```bash
   pip install pytest-rerunfailures
   ```

2. **Configuring Retries**

   You can configure the number of retries directly in your pytest command or in a configuration file (`pytest.ini`, `tox.ini`, or `setup.cfg`).

   - **Command Line**

     To retry each failing test twice before marking it as failed:

     ```bash
     pytest --reruns 2
     ```

   - **Configuration File (pytest.ini)**

     ```ini
     [pytest]
     addopts = --reruns 2
     ```

### Integration with MorningAI

In the context of MorningAI located in repository `RC918/morningai`, integrating test retries involves setting up the correct environment for your test suite to execute with the desired retry logic.

1. **Modify the Test Suite Configuration**

   Assuming you are using a Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline defined in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` or similar, include the pytest command with reruns:

   ```yaml
   jobs:
     build:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
       - uses: actions/checkout@v2
       - name: Set up Python
         uses: actions/setup-python@v2
         with:
           python-version: '3.8'
       - name: Install Dependencies
         run: |
           pip install -r requirements.txt
           pip install pytest-rerunfailures
       - name: Run Tests with Retries
         run: pytest --reruns 2
   ```

2. **Local Testing**

   Before pushing changes to your repository, you can run tests locally using the same command to ensure everything works as expected.

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Dependencies Not Installed**: Ensure all required plugins and dependencies are correctly installed both locally and in your CI environment.
- **Incorrect Configuration File**: Verify that your configuration file (`pytest.ini`, `tox.ini`, or `setup.cfg`) is correctly set up and recognized by pytest.
- **Misinterpretation of Results**: Understand that retries can mask underlying issues. Always review logs for flaky tests and address root causes.
