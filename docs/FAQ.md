# E2E Test FAQ Update for MorningAI

End-to-end (E2E) testing is a crucial part of the software development lifecycle, ensuring that the application behaves as expected from the user's perspective. This FAQ aims to guide developers through the process of setting up, running, and troubleshooting E2E tests in the MorningAI platform.

## What are E2E Tests?

E2E tests simulate real user scenarios, verifying that the entire flow of an application from start to finish works as intended. In the context of MorningAI, these tests ensure that all components of the platform, including autonomous agent systems, documentation management, multi-platform integration, and real-time task orchestration, work together seamlessly.

## Setting Up E2E Tests

Before running E2E tests on MorningAI, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

1. **Node.js and npm**: Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. These are required to run JavaScript-based testing frameworks like Cypress or Puppeteer.
2. **Test Framework**: Choose a testing framework suitable for your project needs. For MorningAI, we recommend Cypress for its easy setup and powerful testing capabilities.

### Installation Steps

1. **Install Cypress**:
    ```bash
    npm install cypress --save-dev
    ```

2. **Configure Cypress**:
   After installation, configure Cypress to suit your testing needs. You can modify `cypress.json` in your project root for global configurations.

3. **Write Your First Test**:
   Create a new test file under `cypress/integration/morningai_spec.js`. Here's a simple example that tests if the MorningAI homepage loads correctly:

    ```javascript
    describe('MorningAI Homepage', () => {
      it('successfully loads', () => {
        cy.visit('https://morningai.example.com') // Change this URL to your app's URL
      })
    })
    ```

## Running E2E Tests

To run your E2E tests with Cypress:

```bash
./node_modules/.bin/cypress open
```

This command opens the Cypress Test Runner, where you can select and run individual test files.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### 1. Tests Timing Out

If your tests frequently time out, consider increasing the default timeout in `cypress.json`:

```json
{
  "defaultCommandTimeout": 10000,
  "pageLoadTimeout": 30000
}
```

### 2. Element Not Found

Ensure that dynamic content has fully loaded before attempting to interact with it. Use `.wait()` or `.should()` functions to wait for elements to appear:

```javascript
cy.get('.dynamic-element', { timeout: 10000 }).should('be.visible');
```

### 3. Cross-Origin Errors

Cypress can run into cross-origin issues when testing applications with multiple domains. Use the `chromeWebSecurity` configuration option to disable Chrome Web Security:

```json
{
  "chromeWebSecurity": false
}
```
