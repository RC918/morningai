# MorningAI System Architecture

MorningAI's architecture is designed to support a scalable, efficient, and highly available service for autonomous code generation, FAQ documentation management, and multi-platform integration. This architecture leverages a modern technology stack and follows best practices for web application development.

## Overview

The system architecture of MorningAI is built around several core components, each serving a distinct role within the platform:

- **Frontend**: Developed with React, utilizing Vite for build optimization and TailwindCSS for styling. This setup provides a responsive and dynamic user interface.
- **Backend**: Python with Flask serves as the backend framework, offering RESTful API endpoints. Gunicorn is used as the WSGI HTTP Server with multi-worker support for handling concurrent requests efficiently.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, enhanced with Row Level Security (RLS) features provided by Supabase. This setup ensures data integrity and security across multi-tenant environments.
- **Queue System**: Redis Queue (RQ) is employed for task queuing to manage background jobs like real-time task orchestration effectively.
- **Orchestration**: LangGraph is utilized for defining and executing agent workflows, enabling complex task sequences to be managed seamlessly.
- **AI Engine**: OpenAI GPT-4 powers content generation tasks, providing high-quality, contextually relevant text outputs.
- **Deployment**: Render.com is used for hosting, taking advantage of its continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) capabilities to streamline updates and maintenance.

## Detailed Breakdown

### Frontend
The frontend layer is built using React, providing an interactive experience. The project configuration relies on Vite for fast builds and TailwindCSS for utility-first styling.

```jsx
// Sample React component with TailwindCSS
function WelcomeMessage() {
  return <div className="text-center p-4 font-bold">Welcome to MorningAI</div>;
}
```

### Backend
Flask serves as the backbone of the backend, handling API requests and interfacing with other system components. Gunicorn ensures that the Flask application can handle multiple requests simultaneously by spawning multiple workers.

```python
# Sample Flask route
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello, World!'
```

### Database Configuration
PostgreSQL is used as the primary data store, with Supabase enhancing its capabilities through additional features like RLS. This ensures that data access is securely managed at the database level.

```sql
-- Example of setting up RLS in PostgreSQL
CREATE TABLE secure_data (
    id serial PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id integer NOT NULL,
    data text NOT NULL
);
ALTER TABLE secure_data ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

### Queue System
Redis Queue manages background tasks such as sending emails or processing asynchronous operations. It integrates smoothly with Flask applications.

```python
# Enqueueing a job in Redis Queue
from rq import Queue
from redis import Redis
redis_conn = Redis()
q = Queue(connection=redis_conn)

result = q.enqueue('my_task', args=(my_arg,), timeout=600)
```

### Deployment on Render.com
Render.com hosts both the frontend and backend components of MorningAI. Continuous integration and deployment are configured through `render.yaml` files in the repository.

```yaml
# Example render.yaml snippet for deploying Flask app
services:
  - type: web
    name: morningai-backend
    env: python
    plan: starter
    buildCommand: "pip install -r requirements.txt"
    startCommand: "gunicorn app:app --workers 3 --threads 2"
```

## Troubleshooting

Common issues developers may encounter include:

1. **Database Connection Errors**: Ensure that your environment variables are correctly set up in your `.env` file or your hosting provider's dashboard.
2. **Failed Deployments on Render.com**: Check the logs provided by Render.com for any errors during the build or startup process. Ensure all dependencies are correctly specified in your `requirements.txt` or `package.json`.
3. **Task Queuing Delays**: If background tasks are delayed or not executing, verify that Redis Queue workers are running and monitor their workload to ensure they're not overwhelmed.
