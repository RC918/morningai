# System Architecture of MorningAI

MorningAI is a robust, multi-tenant SaaS platform designed to enhance productivity through autonomous agent systems for code generation, comprehensive FAQ generation, documentation management, and seamless multi-platform integration. Its architecture is built to support real-time task orchestration and vector memory storage efficiently. Below is an in-depth overview of the system's architecture, designed to help developers navigate and utilize MorningAI effectively.

## Overview

The MorningAI platform leverages a modern technology stack that includes:

- **Frontend**: Developed with React, utilizing Vite for build optimization and TailwindCSS for styling.
- **Backend**: Python with Flask serves as the core backend framework, enhanced with Gunicorn for multi-worker support.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL managed via Supabase, incorporating Row Level Security (RLS) for data integrity and security.
- **Queue System**: Redis Queue (RQ) facilitates asynchronous task processing, equipped with worker heartbeat monitoring for reliability.
- **Orchestration**: LangGraph is used for orchestrating agent workflows, ensuring efficient task management.
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI's GPT-4 powers content generation, providing advanced natural language processing capabilities.
- **Deployment**: Render.com hosts the application, benefiting from its integrated CI/CD pipelines for streamlined deployments.

### Detailed Architecture

MorningAI's architecture is designed to be scalable and resilient, ensuring high availability and performance. Here's a breakdown:

#### Frontend

```jsx
// src/App.jsx
import React from 'react';
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route } from 'react-router-dom';
import HomePage from './pages/HomePage';
import 'tailwindcss/tailwind.css';

function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Route path="/" component={HomePage} />
    </Router>
  );
}

export default App;
```

This snippet demonstrates the application's entry point using React Router for page navigation and TailwindCSS for styling.

#### Backend

```python
# app.py
from flask import Flask
from flask_gunicorn import GunicornApp

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def hello_world():
    return "Hello, MorningAI!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    GunicornApp(app).run()
```

A basic Flask application setup with Gunicorn integration illustrates how the backend serves HTTP requests.

#### Database Integration

Supabase integration ensures secure and scalable database management:

```sql
-- Create a table with RLS enabled
CREATE TABLE documents (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    content TEXT,
    tenant_id INTEGER
);

-- Enable Row Level Security
ALTER TABLE documents ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

This SQL snippet shows how to create a database table with RLS enabled in Supabase.

### Common Troubleshooting Tips

**Issue: Failed Deployment on Render.com**
- Ensure your `render.yaml` file is correctly configured with the appropriate service specifications.
- Check the logs provided by Render.com for specific error messages that can guide troubleshooting.

**Issue: Tasks Stuck in Redis Queue**
- Verify that Redis workers are online and adequately scaled to handle the workload. Use `rq info` command to monitor queue status.
- Inspect worker heartbeat logs to identify any workers that might have become unresponsive.

**Issue: Database Connection Errors**
- Confirm that your Supabase connection strings are correctly configured in your application settings.
- Ensure network rules and permissions in Supabase allow connections from your application's deployment environment.
