# MorningAI System Architecture

MorningAI is designed as a scalable, multi-tenant Software as a Service (SaaS) platform that leverages modern technologies across its stack to provide an efficient and responsive service. The architecture is built to support autonomous agent systems for code generation, FAQ generation, documentation management, and real-time task orchestration, among other features.

## Core Components

### Frontend

- **Technology Stack**: The frontend is developed using React for building user interfaces efficiently with Vite for bundling and TailwindCSS for styling.
- **Code Example**:
  ```jsx
  import React from 'react';
  import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
  import './index.css'; // TailwindCSS
  
  function App() {
    return <div className="app">Welcome to MorningAI</div>;
  }
  
  ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
  ```
- **Path**: `/frontend`

### Backend

- **Technology Stack**: The backend is powered by Flask, a lightweight WSGI web application framework in Python. Gunicorn serves as the WSGI HTTP Server with multi-worker support for handling multiple requests simultaneously.
- **Code Example**:
  ```python
  from flask import Flask
  app = Flask(__name__)
  
  @app.route('/')
  def hello_world():
      return 'Hello, World from MorningAI!'
  
  if __name__ == '__main__':
      app.run()
  ```
- **Path**: `/backend`

### Database

- **Technology Used**: PostgreSQL for relational data storage, enhanced with Row Level Security (RLS) for ensuring data isolation across tenants. Supabase is used as a scalable backend platform that extends PostgreSQL.
- **Path**: `/database`

### Queue System

- **Technology Used**: Redis Queue (RQ) handles asynchronous job queues to manage background tasks efficiently. It allows task orchestration with worker heartbeat monitoring to ensure reliability.
- **Code Example**:
  ```python
  from redis import Redis
  from rq import Queue
  
  redis_conn = Redis()
  q = Queue(connection=redis_conn)
  
  def background_task():
      print("Task running")
  
  job = q.enqueue(background_task)
  ```
- **Path**: `/queue`

### Orchestration and AI

- **Orchestration**: LangGraph is used for managing agent workflows, ensuring tasks are executed in an efficient and orderly manner.
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI's GPT-4 powers the platform's content generation capabilities, including code generation and dynamic FAQ creation.
- **Path**: `/orchestration`, `/ai`

### Deployment

- **Platform**: Render.com supports the deployment of the MorningAI platform, utilizing Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) practices to streamline updates and maintenance.

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

1. **Frontend Issues**: Ensure dependencies are up to date and compatible. Use `npm install` or `yarn install` to update dependencies.
2. **Backend Issues**: For server errors, check the Flask application logs for detailed error messages. Ensure Gunicorn is properly configured for your environment.
3. **Database Connectivity**: Verify PostgreSQL or Supabase credentials are correct and the database service is running.
4. **Queue Processing Delays**: If tasks are not being processed as expected, check Redis server health and worker status through RQ dashboard or command line tools.
5. **Deployment Failures on Render.com**: Review build logs on Render.com for specific errors during the build or deployment process.
