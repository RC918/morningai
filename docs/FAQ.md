# Handling Redis Outage in MorningAI

When encountering a Redis outage in the MorningAI platform, it's crucial to understand the steps for diagnosis, mitigation, and recovery to ensure minimal disruption to the autonomous agent system, task orchestration, and real-time functionalities that rely on Redis Queue (RQ).

## Understanding the Impact of a Redis Outage

Redis, serving as the backbone for task queuing (via RQ) and real-time operations within MorningAI, impacts several components:
- **Task Orchestration:** Delays or failures in executing queued tasks.
- **Real-Time Operations:** Interruptions in real-time data processing and agent workflows.
- **Session Management:** Potential issues in user session management if sessions are stored in Redis.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose a Redis outage:
1. Verify the connectivity to the Redis instance using `redis-cli`:
   ```bash
   redis-cli -h [REDIS_HOST] -p [REDIS_PORT] ping
   ```
   Replace `[REDIS_HOST]` and `[REDIS_PORT]` with your actual Redis host and port numbers. A healthy response is `PONG`.

2. Check the Redis server logs for any anomalies or errors that might indicate the cause of the outage.

3. Review system metrics (CPU, memory usage, network I/O) to identify resource bottlenecks.

## Mitigation Strategies

### Immediate Actions

1. **Switch to a Standby Redis Instance:** If you have a standby Redis setup (highly recommended), switch over to it to minimize downtime.
   
2. **Scale Up Resources:** If the outage is due to resource constraints, temporarily scale up your Redis server resources.

### Long-Term Solutions

1. **Implement Redis Sentinel** for automatic failover management.
2. **Use Cluster Mode** to distribute data across multiple Redis nodes for higher availability.
3. **Regularly Monitor** resources and set up alerts for abnormal patterns.

## Recovery

After addressing the immediate cause of the outage:
1. Gradually redirect traffic back to the primary Redis instance if a standby was used.
2. Restart affected services within MorningAI that rely on Redis. For Flask applications using Gunicorn with multi-worker support:
   ```bash
   gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:5000 "morningai:create_app()"
   ```
3. Requeue lost tasks if necessary by inspecting `failed` queues in RQ and manually requeuing them:
   ```python
   from rq import Queue
   from redis import Redis
   
   redis_conn = Redis()
   q = Queue(connection=redis_conn)
   
   failed_jobs = q.failed_job_registry.get_job_ids()  # Retrieve failed job IDs
   for job_id in failed_jobs:
       q.requeue(job_id)  # Requeue jobs
   ```

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

- **Connection Issues:** Ensure firewall rules allow traffic on the port used by Redis.
- **Memory Pressure:** Regularly monitor memory usage and configure eviction policies appropriately.
- **Persistent Data Loss:** Enable RDB/AOF persistence settings in your Redis configuration to mitigate data loss.
