# MorningAI System Architecture

The system architecture of MorningAI is designed to support a scalable, efficient, and flexible multi-tenant SaaS platform. It incorporates a blend of modern technologies and frameworks to provide autonomous code generation, FAQ generation, documentation management, and multi-platform integration capabilities. Hereâ€™s a comprehensive breakdown of the MorningAI system architecture:

## Core Components

### Frontend
- **Technology Stack**: The frontend is built using React for dynamic user interfaces, Vite as the build tool for fast development and production builds, and TailwindCSS for utility-first styling.
- **Architecture Details**: The frontend structure is modular, with components organized to facilitate reusability and maintainability. It connects to the backend via RESTful APIs or WebSocket connections for real-time functionalities.

### Backend
- **Technology Stack**: Python and Flask form the core of the backend, providing a lightweight yet powerful framework for web development. Gunicorn serves as the WSGI HTTP Server to manage requests with multi-worker support for scalability.
- **Architecture Details**: The backend follows MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture principles to separate concerns, making the codebase easier to manage and scale. Endpoints are defined for various functionalities including user authentication, data processing, and AI interactions.

### Database
- **Technology Stack**: PostgreSQL with Row Level Security (RLS) features is used for data storage, managed through Supabase which adds additional functionalities like authentication and real-time subscriptions.
- **Architecture Details**: The database schema is designed to support multi-tenancy from the ground up, ensuring data isolation and security between tenants. pgvector/Supabase is utilized for vector memory storage, optimizing search and recommendation features.

### Queue System
- **Technology Stack**: Redis Queue (RQ) handles task queuing to efficiently manage background jobs such as long-running computations or external API calls.
- **Architecture Details**: Workers pull tasks from the queue managed by RQ, processing them asynchronously to improve application responsiveness. Worker heartbeat monitoring ensures reliability and fault tolerance in task execution.

### Orchestration & AI
- **Orchestration Tool**: LangGraph orchestrates complex agent workflows, enabling sophisticated autonomous operations within the platform.
- **AI Technology**: OpenAI's GPT-4 powers content generation tasks including FAQ generation and code suggestions, providing high-quality outputs based on vast amounts of training data.

### Deployment
- **Platform**: Render.com is used for hosting with Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines in place to automate deployment processes.
- **Details**: The CI/CD setup ensures that code changes are automatically tested and deployed to production environments, maintaining code quality and reducing manual intervention.

## Code Example

While specific code examples depend on the area you're working on, here's a general example of how a Flask route may look in our backend:

```python
from flask import Flask, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/api/status', methods=['GET'])
def get_status():
    return jsonify({"status": "Healthy"}), 200

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

This simple example demonstrates setting up an endpoint in Flask which returns a JSON response indicating the application's status.

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

1. **Frontend Not Updating**: Ensure your browser cache is cleared or use incognito mode to check recent changes.
2. **Database Connection Issues**: Verify your Supabase connection strings are correct and that your IP is whitelisted if necessary.
3. **Backend Service Unresponsive**: Check Gunicorn logs for errors; ensure it's running with sufficient workers according to your server's CPU cores.
4. **Tasks Not Processing in Queue**: Confirm Redis server is up and that RQ workers are running. Use RQ Dashboard or command-line tools to inspect queues.
5. **Deployment Failures on Render.com**: Check build logs for errors; ensure all environment variables are correctly set up in Render.com dashboard.
