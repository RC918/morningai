# MorningAI System Architecture

MorningAI employs a modern, scalable, and resilient architecture designed to provide a robust platform for autonomous code generation, FAQ management, documentation management, and multi-platform integration. Below is an in-depth explanation of each component within the MorningAI system architecture.

## Frontend

The frontend is built with **React** utilizing **Vite** as the build tool and **TailwindCSS** for styling. This combination allows for a fast development experience with hot module replacement (HMR) and an easily customizable UI.

### Code Example:

```jsx
// src/App.jsx
import React from 'react';
import 'tailwindcss/tailwind.css';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="app">
      <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold underline">
        Welcome to MorningAI
      </h1>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

For more on how to work with React and Vite in our project, refer to the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) and [Vite documentation](https://vitejs.dev/guide/).

## Backend

The backend is powered by **Python** using **Flask** as the web framework and **Gunicorn** with multi-worker support for handling concurrent requests efficiently. Flask provides a lightweight way to build RESTful services, while Gunicorn ensures these services are reliably served to end users.

### Code Example:

```python
# app.py
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello, World from MorningAI!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

Refer to the [Flask documentation](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/) and [Gunicorn documentation](https://gunicorn.org/#docs) for further details.

## Database

**PostgreSQL**, managed by **Supabase** with Row Level Security (RLS), serves as the database layer. It ensures data integrity and security while providing powerful query capabilities.

### Configuration Example:

To configure RLS in Supabase/PostgreSQL:

```sql
-- Enable RLS for a table
ALTER TABLE your_table ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Add a policy
CREATE POLICY your_policy ON your_table FOR SELECT USING (user_id = auth.uid());
```

Check out [Supabase documentation](https://supabase.io/docs/guides/database) for more on setting up your database schemas and RLS policies.

## Queue

For real-time task orchestration, MorningAI uses **Redis Queue (RQ)**. It is configured with worker heartbeat monitoring to ensure tasks are processed reliably without loss or duplication.

### Setup Example:

To start a worker:

```bash
rq worker --url redis://your_redis_instance
```

For detailed setup instructions, visit [RQ documentation](http://python-rq.org/docs/).

## Orchestration

Task workflows are orchestrated using **LangGraph**, ensuring that complex operations involving multiple steps can be handled efficiently and reliably.

## AI

Content generation within MorningAI leverages **OpenAI GPT-4**, offering advanced natural language understanding and generation capabilities for creating accurate and contextually relevant documentation and FAQs.

## Deployment

The entire stack is deployed on **Render.com**, benefiting from its seamless CI/CD pipelines that facilitate easy updates and maintenance of the application.

### Troubleshooting Tips:

- Ensure all environment variables are correctly set up in Render.com for access to databases, Redis instances, and external APIs.
- For issues related to frontend builds, verify the `vite.config.js` file settings.
- Backend service not responding? Check Gunicorn logs for errors or misconfigurations.
- Database connectivity issues often stem from incorrect RLS policies or connection strings. Verify these in your Supabase dashboard.
- Task processing delays in RQ might indicate overloaded workers or Redis performance issues. Monitoring worker health can provide insights into potential bottlenecks.

For further assistance, consult the respective component's official documentation or reach out through our project's GitHub discussions.
