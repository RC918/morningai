# System Architecture of MorningAI

MorningAI is designed as a multi-tenant SaaS platform, employing a modern technology stack and architecture to provide an autonomous agent system for code generation, comprehensive FAQ generation, documentation management, and multi-platform integration. This document outlines the system's architecture to help developers understand and effectively utilize MorningAI.

## Overview

The system architecture of MorningAI is built around several core components, including frontend applications, backend services, databases, queue systems for task orchestration, and AI for content generation. Below is a detailed breakdown of each component and how they interact within the system.

### Frontend

- **Technologies Used**: React, Vite, TailwindCSS
- **Functionality**: Provides the user interface for interacting with the MorningAI platform. Implemented using React for its reusable components and Vite for efficient bundling. TailwindCSS is used for styling to ensure a responsive and modern UI.

### Backend

- **Technologies Used**: Python, Flask, Gunicorn
- **Functionality**: Serves as the backbone of the platform, handling business logic, authentication, database operations, and integration with other services. Flask is chosen for its simplicity and flexibility in building web applications. Gunicorn is used as the WSGI HTTP Server to manage multiple workers for handling requests concurrently.

### Database

- **Technology Used**: PostgreSQL (Supabase) with Row Level Security (RLS)
- **Functionality**: Stores all persistent data related to users, tasks, configurations, etc. Supabase adds real-time capabilities and simplifies queries with its powerful API layer on top of PostgreSQL. RLS ensures that data access is securely managed at the database level.

### Queue System

- **Technology Used**: Redis Queue (RQ)
- **Functionality**: Manages background tasks such as code generation or document processing. RQ is selected for its simplicity and integration ease with Python applications. Worker heartbeat monitoring is implemented to ensure reliability and timely execution of tasks.

### Orchestration & AI

- **Technologies Used**: LangGraph for agent workflows; OpenAI GPT-4 for content generation
- **Functionality**: LangGraph orchestrates complex workflows involving multiple agents or steps in a task. OpenAI's GPT-4 powers content generation, offering high-quality outputs based on large datasets.

### Deployment

- **Platform Used**: Render.com with CI/CD
- **Functionality**: Automates deployment processes ensuring that updates are smoothly rolled out without downtime. Render.com supports easy scaling and management of the infrastructure required by MorningAI.

## Code Examples

While specific code examples depend on the task at hand, here's a generic example illustrating how to initiate a background task using Redis Queue in Flask:

```python
from redis import Redis
from rq import Queue
from your_task_module import your_task_function

# Initialize Redis connection and queue
redis_conn = Redis()
q = Queue(connection=redis_conn)

# Enqueue a task
job = q.enqueue(your_task_function, 'argument')

```

## Troubleshooting Tips

1. **Flask Application Errors**:
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed correctly.
   - Verify environment variables are set appropriately.
2. **Database Connection Issues**:
   - Check Supabase API keys and permissions.
   - Review Row Level Security policies if encountering access denials.
3. **Task Processing Delays**:
   - Monitor RQ Dashboard for queued jobs.
   - Increase worker count if necessary based on workload.
