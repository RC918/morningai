# Handling a Redis Outage in MorningAI

When using MorningAI, a Redis outage can significantly impact real-time task orchestration and the overall functionality of the platform. Understanding how to effectively manage such an outage is crucial for maintaining the stability and reliability of your services. This section will guide you through the steps to take during a Redis outage, provide code examples for common scenarios, and offer troubleshooting tips.

## Overview

MorningAI relies on Redis Queue (RQ) for managing background tasks and orchestrating real-time operations. An outage can disrupt these processes, leading to delays or failures in task execution. Recognizing the signs of an outage and knowing how to respond is essential for minimizing downtime.

### Signs of a Redis Outage

- Tasks are not being processed or are significantly delayed.
- The RQ dashboard shows workers as unavailable or idle despite pending tasks.
- Connection errors in the application logs related to Redis.

### Immediate Steps

1. **Verify the Outage**: Confirm that Redis is indeed the source of the issue by checking the Redis server status and logs.
2. **Check Connectivity**: Ensure that network issues are not preventing MorningAI from connecting to Redis.
3. **Review Application Logs**: Look for any error messages related to Redis connections or task processing failures.

## Code Examples

### Checking Redis Connection Status

You can use a simple Python script to check the connectivity with your Redis instance:

```python
import redis

try:
    r = redis.Redis(host='your_redis_server', port=6379, db=0)
    print("Connected to Redis:", r.ping())
except redis.RedisError as e:
    print("Redis connection error:", e)
```

Replace `'your_redis_server'` with your actual Redis server address.

### Managing Tasks During an Outage

It's wise to implement fallback mechanisms for critical tasks that must continue even during an outage. Below is an example using Python Flask context:

```python
from rq import Queue
from redis import Redis
from flask import current_app as app

def enqueue_task_or_fallback():
    try:
        q = Queue(connection=Redis())
        q.enqueue('path.to.your.function', args=(arg1, arg2))
    except Exception as e:
        app.logger.error(f"Failed to enqueue task: {e}")
        # Implement your fallback strategy here
```

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

- **Restarting Redis Service**: Sometimes, simply restarting the Redis service can resolve connectivity issues.
- **Resource Checks**: Ensure that your Redis server has adequate memory and isn't hitting resource limits.
- **Network Configuration**: Verify that there are no changes in network policies or firewall settings that could block communication between MorningAI and Redis.

If after taking these steps you continue experiencing issues, consider reaching out to your infrastructure team or seeking support from the Redis community.
