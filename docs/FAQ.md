# Handling Redis Outage in MorningAI

When facing a Redis outage, it's critical to understand the implications it has on MorningAI's operations and how to mitigate or resolve the issue. MorningAI utilizes Redis Queue (RQ) for task orchestration, which is essential for managing asynchronous tasks and real-time operations. An outage can disrupt task processing, leading to delays or failures in task execution.

## Understanding the Impact

Redis, being at the heart of MorningAI's task queue system, impacts several components:
- **Task Orchestration**: Task distribution and execution via RQ are halted.
- **Real-Time Operations**: Any feature relying on real-time data processing or task execution will experience downtime.
- **Worker Heartbeat Monitoring**: The monitoring of worker health/status is interrupted.

## Immediate Steps During an Outage

1. **Identify the Outage**: Confirm that Redis is indeed the source of the issue. This can be done using Redis CLI tools or through your cloud provider's dashboard.

    ```bash
    redis-cli ping
    ```

    A response of `PONG` indicates Redis is operational. Lack of response or an error suggests an outage or connectivity issue.

2. **Check Logs for Errors**: Review application and Redis logs for any errors or warnings that might indicate the cause of the outage.

    ```bash
    tail -f /var/log/redis/redis-server.log
    ```

3. **Notify Stakeholders**: Inform team members and stakeholders about the outage and potential impact on operations.

4. **Engage Backup Systems**: If available, switch to a standby Redis instance to minimize downtime.

5. **Contact Support**: If hosted by a cloud provider, contact their support team for assistance in resolving the issue.

## Post-Outage Recovery

After resolving the Redis connectivity issue:

1. **Restart Services**: Ensure that all services dependent on Redis are restarted to re-establish connections.

    ```bash
    systemctl restart gunicorn.service
    ```

2. **Monitor Logs and Performance**: Keep an eye on application logs and performance metrics to ensure everything is running smoothly.

3. **Review Incident**: Analyze the cause of the outage and implement measures to prevent future occurrences. This could involve infrastructure changes, updating monitoring alerts, or improving failover strategies.

4. **Update Documentation**: Record the incident details, resolution steps, and any lessons learned in your project documentation to improve future response efforts.

## Troubleshooting Tips

- Ensure network connectivity between your application servers and Redis.
- Verify Redis server configuration files for any misconfigurations.
- Check system resources (CPU, memory usage) on the server hosting Redis.
- Evaluate Redis security settings (e.g., firewalls or access controls) that may inadvertently block connections.
