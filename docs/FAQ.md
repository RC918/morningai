# Testing Sentry `trace_id` in MorningAI

Sentry is an open-source error tracking tool that helps developers monitor and fix crashes in real-time. The `trace_id` is a unique identifier for each request or transaction, allowing developers to trace errors and performance issues back to their source. In the context of MorningAI, integrating Sentry with a focus on utilizing the `trace_id` can significantly enhance debugging and error tracking capabilities.

## Understanding `trace_id` in Sentry

The `trace_id` is part of Sentry's tracing feature, which enables you to follow the path of a request across various services and components in your application. This is especially useful in distributed systems where a request passes through multiple microservices.

### How to Use `trace_id` in MorningAI

To leverage `trace_id` within MorningAI, you need to integrate Sentry into your application first. Here's a basic guide on setting it up:

1. **Sentry SDK Installation**: Ensure you have Sentry SDK installed in your project. For a Flask application like MorningAI, you would typically use:

    ```bash
    pip install --upgrade sentry-sdk[flask]
    ```

2. **Configure Sentry in Your Application**:
    - Import and initialize Sentry in your Flask app within `app/__init__.py` or wherever your Flask application is configured.

    ```python
    import sentry_sdk
    from sentry_sdk.integrations.flask import FlaskIntegration

    sentry_sdk.init(
        dsn="your_sentry_dsn_here",
        integrations=[FlaskIntegration()],
        traces_sample_rate=1.0 # Adjust sample rate as needed
    )
    ```

3. **Retrieving and Using `trace_id`**:
   - Within any part of your code, especially within error handling or critical workflow sections, you can access the current scope's `trace_id` using the Sentry SDK.

   ```python
   from sentry_sdk import Hub

   def log_error():
       trace_id = Hub.current.scope.span.trace_id
       print(f"Error Trace ID: {trace_id}")
       # Additional logging or error handling logic here
   ```

### Common Troubleshooting Tips

- **Trace ID Not Available**: If you find that the `trace_id` is not being generated or is unavailable, ensure that the transaction containing the request has been started correctly. Transactions can be manually started with Sentry's SDK if automatic detection doesn't work as expected.
- **Errors Not Showing in Sentry Dashboard**: Check if the DSN (Data Source Name) in your configuration is correct and that your network allows outgoing requests to Sentry's servers.
- **Sampling Rate Issues**: If you're noticing missing data or too much data, adjust the `traces_sample_rate`. A rate of 1.0 captures 100% of transactions but might be overwhelming; experiment to find a balance that suits your needs.
- **Performance Impact**: Monitor your application's performance after integrating Sentry, as capturing 100% of transactions can impact performance. Adjusting sampling rates or selectively instrumenting transactions can mitigate this.

Integrating Sentry and utilizing its tracing capabilities, including `trace_id`, can greatly improve how you monitor, debug, and optimize MorningAI. By following these guidelines, developers can ensure they're leveraging these tools effectively within their projects.
