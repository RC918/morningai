# Testing Sentry Trace ID in MorningAI

When developing and maintaining applications, especially those as intricate as MorningAI, efficient error tracking and performance monitoring are crucial. Sentry is an open-source error tracking tool that helps developers monitor and fix crashes in real time. The `trace_id` feature of Sentry is particularly useful for tracing errors and performance issues across different services in a distributed system. This FAQ aims to guide developers on how to test the Sentry `trace_id` within the MorningAI platform.

## Understanding Sentry `trace_id`

The `trace_id` is a unique identifier used by Sentry to trace a series of related events or transactions across multiple systems, services, or microservices. It is an essential part of distributed tracing, allowing developers to follow the path of a request through various microservices and pinpoint where failures or performance bottlenecks occur.

### How to Implement and Test Sentry `trace_id` in MorningAI

#### Prerequisites

Ensure you have:
- Access to the RC918/morningai repository.
- The Sentry SDK installed and configured in your MorningAI project.

#### Step 1: Configuration

1. In your Flask app initialization within the MorningAI platform (`/backend/app/__init__.py`), ensure you have Sentry SDK set up with tracing enabled:

```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.flask import FlaskIntegration

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="your_sentry_dsn_here",
    integrations=[FlaskIntegration()],
    traces_sample_rate=1.0 # Adjust based on your needs
)
```

2. Configure your frontend application (if applicable) similarly, ensuring you enable tracing:

```javascript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react";
import { Integrations } from "@sentry/tracing";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "your_sentry_dsn_here",
  integrations: [new Integrations.BrowserTracing()],
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0, // Adjust based on your needs
});
```

#### Step 2: Generating and Testing `trace_id`

To generate and test a `trace_id`, simulate or trigger an event that would cause an error or a transaction trace. For instance, in a backend Python route:

```python
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/trigger_error')
def trigger_error():
    division_by_zero = 1 / 0 # This will generate an error
    return "This should not appear"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()
```

When this endpoint is hit, Sentry captures the error along with a `trace_id`. You can find this `trace_id` within the Sentry issue interface under the "Tags" section of the detailed view of the reported issue.

### Common Troubleshooting Tips

- **Issue**: Missing `trace_id` in reported issues.
  - **Solution**: Ensure that tracing is enabled both in backend and frontend configurations with a proper sample rate.
- **Issue**: Errors not showing up in Sentry dashboard.
  - **Solution**: Verify that your DSN (Data Source Name) is correctly configured in both backend and frontend applications.
- **Issue**: Performance bottlenecks not being traced accurately.
  - **Solution**: Review your sampling rate; too low of a rate might miss critical transactions, while too high of a rate might overwhelm your dashboard with too much data.
