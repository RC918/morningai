# Handling MorningAI During a Redis Outage

When using MorningAI, a Redis outage can significantly impact the real-time task orchestration feature of the platform, as it relies on Redis Queue (RQ) for managing background jobs. Understanding how to navigate and mitigate issues during such outages is crucial for maintaining operational stability. This FAQ provides guidance on how to manage your MorningAI instance during a Redis outage.

## Comprehensive Explanation

Redis is an in-memory data structure store used by MorningAI for queuing tasks and managing worker processes. RQ, which is built on top of Redis, allows asynchronous execution of Python functions. During a Redis outage, queued tasks cannot be processed, leading to potential delays in task execution and system performance degradation.

### Immediate Actions During an Outage

1. **Identify the Scope of the Outage**: Determine if the outage is affecting all instances or specific to your deployment.
2. **Pause Task Submission**: To prevent task backlog and potential data loss, temporarily pause or limit new task submissions.
3. **Monitor the Situation**: Keep an eye on updates from your Redis hosting provider or internal monitoring tools to assess the outage's impact and expected resolution time.

### Code Example: Pausing Task Submission

If you're using Flask with RQ in your backend, you might want to conditionally disable task queueing based on the Redis connection status:

```python
from redis.exceptions import RedisError
from rq import Queue
from myapp import create_app, redis_conn

app = create_app()
queue = Queue(connection=redis_conn)

def enqueue_task_if_redis_available(task, *args, **kwargs):
    try:
        # Attempt to enqueue a task
        queue.enqueue(task, args=args, kwargs=kwargs)
    except RedisError:
        # Handle the situation when Redis is down
        app.logger.error("Failed to enqueue task due to Redis outage.")
```

### Common Troubleshooting Tips

**Issue**: Tasks are not being processed despite Redis being back online.

**Solution**: Ensure that all RQ workers are restarted after the outage is resolved. Sometimes workers might not recover from a connection loss automatically.

```bash
# Example command to restart RQ workers
$ rq worker --with-scheduler --burst
```

**Issue**: Lost tasks during the outage.

**Solution**: Implement logging or a secondary queue mechanism to track tasks that failed to enqueue during the outage. This can help in re-queuing them once Redis service is restored.

**Issue**: Performance degradation post-outage.

**Solution**: Monitor system performance closely after an outage. You may need to scale up your Redis instance or adjust worker counts based on the backlog and operational needs.

Understanding how to effectively manage a Redis outage can help minimize its impact on MorningAI's functionality and ensure that your application remains as stable as possible under adverse conditions.
