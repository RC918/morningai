# System Architecture of MorningAI

MorningAI employs a robust and scalable system architecture designed to handle autonomous agent system for code generation, FAQ generation, documentation management, multi-platform integration, real-time task orchestration, and vector memory storage efficiently. This architecture is built using a combination of modern technologies and frameworks to ensure high performance, reliability, and scalability.

## Core Components

### Frontend

- **Technology Stack**: The frontend is developed with React, utilizing Vite as the build tool for faster development and TailwindCSS for styling.
- **Directory Structure**: Located under `frontend/`, the UI components, services for API calls, and state management logic can be found.

### Backend

- **Framework**: Python Flask serves as the backend framework, providing RESTful APIs that the frontend consumes. Gunicorn is used as the WSGI HTTP Server with multi-worker support for handling concurrent requests efficiently.
- **Directory Structure**: Backend code resides in `backend/`, where you will find Flask app initialization (`app.py`), API routes (`routes/`), and business logic (`services/`).

### Database

- **Database System**: PostgreSQL hosted on Supabase, which offers additional features like Row Level Security for better data protection.
- **Integration Points**: Database schema and migrations are managed within `database/`. Supabase's real-time capabilities are utilized for live updates across clients.

### Queue System

- **Queue Management**: Redis Queue (RQ) is employed for managing background tasks such as long-running processes or asynchronous operations.
- **Worker Monitoring**: A heartbeat monitoring system is in place to ensure workers are alive and processing tasks efficiently. Worker scripts can be found under `workers/`.

### Orchestration

- **Workflow Management**: LangGraph is utilized for defining agent workflows in a graph-based configuration, allowing complex task orchestrations.
- **Configuration Files**: Workflow definitions are maintained in `orchestration/`, detailing the sequence of tasks and decision points.

### AI Integration

- **AI Service**: OpenAI's GPT-4 powers content generation tasks including FAQ content creation and code generation.
- **Integration Code**: AI-related code is primarily located in `ai_services/`, encapsulating interactions with OpenAI's API.

### Deployment

- **Platform**: Render.com is used for hosting both frontend and backend services with continuous integration/deployment pipelines configured for automatic updates upon code commits.
- **CI/CD Configuration**: CI/CD workflows are defined in `.render/`, specifying how builds and deployments are managed.

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

**Frontend Issues**
1. If changes are not reflecting, ensure Vite's hot module replacement (HMR) is working or try clearing the browser cache.

**Backend Issues**
1. For server errors, check Gunicorn logs for specific error messages. Ensure all environment variables are correctly set.
2. If connecting to the database fails, verify Supabase credentials and network access restrictions.

**Deployment Issues**
1. Deployment failures on Render.com often stem from configuration errors in `.render/render.yaml`. Ensure paths and build commands are correct.
2. For CI/CD issues, check the build logs on Render.com for specific errors during the build or deployment process.

By understanding MorningAI's system architecture, developers can more effectively navigate the project, troubleshoot issues, and contribute to its development.
