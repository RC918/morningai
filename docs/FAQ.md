# MorningAI System Architecture

The MorningAI platform is designed as a multi-tenant Software as a Service (SaaS) solution, leveraging a modern stack to offer autonomous code generation, documentation management, and real-time task orchestration. This section provides an overview of the system architecture, aimed at helping developers understand and effectively utilize the MorningAI platform.

## Overview

MorningAI's architecture is built to support scalability, performance, and ease of integration. It consists of several key components:

- **Frontend:** Developed with React, Vite, and TailwindCSS for a responsive and modern user interface.
- **Backend:** Python and Flask are used for server-side logic, with Gunicorn serving as the WSGI HTTP Server to manage multiple worker processes.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL, enhanced with Row Level Security (RLS) via Supabase for secure data storage and vector memory storage.
- **Queue System:** Redis Queue (RQ) is utilized for managing background jobs with worker heartbeat monitoring to ensure reliability.
- **Orchestration:** LangGraph orchestrates agent workflows, facilitating complex task management.
- **AI Layer:** Integrates OpenAI's GPT-4 for cutting-edge content generation capabilities.
- **Deployment:** Hosted on Render.com with continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipelines in place for streamlined updates.

### Code Examples

#### Flask Application Initialization

```python
from flask import Flask
from werkzeug.middleware.proxy_fix import ProxyFix

app = Flask(__name__)
app.wsgi_app = ProxyFix(app.wsgi_app)
```

#### Gunicorn Configuration

Example `gunicorn.conf.py`:

```python
workers = 4
bind = '0.0.0.0:8000'
worker_class = 'gevent'
```

#### Redis Queue Setup

```python
import redis
from rq import Queue

r = redis.Redis()
q = Queue(connection=r)

def background_task():
    # Your background task code here
    pass

job = q.enqueue(background_task)
```

### Common Troubleshooting Tips

**Issue**: Worker processes hang or fail to start  
**Solution**: Ensure Gunicorn is properly configured with adequate workers and that Redis Queue has sufficient resources available. Check the logs for any specific error messages.

**Issue**: Database connection errors  
**Solution**: Verify your Supabase credentials and database URL. Ensure that your database is running and accessible from your application environment.

**Issue**: Frontend not updating after deployment  
**Solution**: Confirm that your CI/CD pipeline on Render.com has successfully completed. Clear browser cache or use a hard refresh to ensure the latest version is loaded.
