# Testing Sentry Trace ID in MorningAI

When integrating Sentry into a project like MorningAI, testing the `trace_id` functionality is crucial for monitoring and identifying issues across the service's distributed architecture. This FAQ aims to guide developers through the process of testing and validating Sentry's `trace_id` within the MorningAI platform.

## Understanding Sentry `trace_id`

Sentry uses `trace_id` to track and aggregate errors, performance issues, and monitor distributed tracing across services. It's a unique identifier for a set of events or transactions that span across multiple systems or microservices, allowing developers to trace the path of a request or process through the entire system.

## How to Test Sentry `trace_id` in MorningAI

Testing the `trace_id` involves simulating scenarios where errors or performance issues are likely to occur and verifying that these incidents are correctly logged and linked in Sentry with a consistent `trace_id`.

### Step 1: Configuration

Ensure Sentry is properly configured in your MorningAI setup. This typically involves setting up your Sentry DSN (Data Source Name) in your project settings. For MorningAI, this configuration might be located in:

```python
# File: morningai/config.py

SENTRY_DSN = "your_sentry_dsn_here"
```

And initializing Sentry in your application:

```python
# File: morningai/app/__init__.py

import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.flask import FlaskIntegration

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="your_sentry_dsn_here",
    integrations=[FlaskIntegration()]
)
```

### Step 2: Triggering Errors or Events

To test, you'll need to trigger an error or an event that would generate a `trace_id`. This can be done by intentionally causing an error in your application logic or via API calls that result in an error state.

Example of intentionally triggering an error:

```python
# File: morningai/routes/example.py

@app.route('/trigger_error')
def trigger_error():
    division_by_zero = 1 / 0  # This will cause a ZeroDivisionError
    return "This should not appear"
```

### Step 3: Verifying Trace ID in Sentry

After triggering the error, go to your Sentry dashboard and locate the error event. Within the event details, you should find the `trace_id`. This ID links this error event with any other related events across different services or requests involved in the process.

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

- **Sentry DSN Not Set**: Ensure that your Sentry DSN is correctly configured in your project settings.
- **Incorrect Initialization**: Verify that Sentry has been initialized correctly with Flask integration as shown above.
- **No Errors Showing Up**: Make sure you're triggering an actual error and that your environment (development/production) is set up to send errors to Sentry.
- **Mismatched Trace IDs**: Ensure that all parts of your distributed system are correctly forwarding and using the same `trace_id` for related processes.

By following these steps, you should be able to test and validate the functionality of `trace_id` within your MorningAI platform, ensuring that you can effectively monitor and troubleshoot issues across your distributed services.
