# Testing Sentry Trace ID in MorningAI

When integrating Sentry into MorningAI for enhanced error tracking and performance monitoring, it's crucial to ensure that the Sentry `trace_id` is correctly implemented and functioning. This FAQ provides guidance on how to test the Sentry `trace_id` within the MorningAI platform.

## Understanding Sentry Trace ID

Sentry's `trace_id` is a unique identifier for each request or transaction, allowing developers to trace events across the system's components and services. It is essential for debugging and identifying performance issues in distributed systems.

## Implementing and Testing Sentry Trace ID

### Prerequisites

- Ensure Sentry is set up in your MorningAI project.
- The Sentry SDK should be correctly initialized in your project setup.

### Code Example: Initializing Sentry

Here's a basic example of initializing Sentry in a Flask application, which is part of MorningAI's backend:

```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.flask import FlaskIntegration

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="your_sentry_dsn_here",
    integrations=[FlaskIntegration()],
    traces_sample_rate=1.0 # Capture 100% of transactions for performance monitoring.
)
```

### Generating and Testing `trace_id`

1. **Trigger an Event**: To test the `trace_id`, trigger an event or request that you know will be captured by Sentry. This could be an error or a performance transaction.

2. **Retrieve the Trace ID**: Once the event is captured, go to your Sentry dashboard. Find the event and retrieve the `trace_id` from the event details.

3. **Verifying Trace ID Consistency**: Ensure that the `trace_id` is consistent across related events or transactions. The `trace_id` can be used to trace the flow of a request through different services or components in your application.

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

- **Incorrect DSN Configuration**: Ensure that your DSN (Data Source Name) is correctly configured in your project settings. An incorrect DSN can prevent events from being sent to Sentry.
- **Sampling Rate Issues**: If you're not seeing all expected events, check your `traces_sample_rate`. A low value might result in only a fraction of events being captured.
- **Check SDK Initialization**: Make sure that the Sentry SDK initialization code runs before any other part of your application logic that you wish to monitor.
- **Network Issues**: In some cases, network configurations or firewalls might block requests to Sentry's servers. Ensure there are no such barriers in your deployment environment.
