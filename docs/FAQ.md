# Test Retry Mechanism in MorningAI

In the context of software development, especially within a SaaS platform like MorningAI, ensuring the reliability and robustness of the system is crucial. One way to achieve this is by implementing a test retry mechanism. This FAQ aims to help developers understand and use the test retry functionality in the MorningAI platform, specifically within the RC918/morningai repository.

## Understanding Test Retry Mechanism

The test retry mechanism is designed to automatically rerun failed tests before marking them as failures. This approach helps in mitigating issues caused by transient conditions such as network latency, temporary service unavailability, or random test order dependencies.

MorningAI utilizes this mechanism to enhance its CI/CD pipeline's reliability, ensuring that only genuine failures are reported. This approach significantly reduces manual intervention for flaky tests and improves overall development efficiency.

### How It Works

When a test fails during the CI/CD process, the test retry mechanism triggers a predefined number of retries before marking the test as failed. Each retry involves rerunning the entire test or a specific part of it under the same conditions.

### Configuration

To configure the test retry mechanism in MorningAI's CI/CD pipeline, you can modify the `ci-cd-config.yml` file located at `/config/ci-cd-config.yml` within the RC918/morningai repository. Below is an example configuration for integrating test retries:

```yaml
test:
  override:
    - command: "pytest --reruns 3"
      description: "Running tests with retry mechanism"
```

In this example, `--reruns 3` specifies that each test should be retried up to 3 times if it fails.

## Code Example

Here's a simple code snippet demonstrating how to integrate pytest's rerun functionality in a Python testing script:

```python
# test_example.py
import pytest
import requests

def check_external_service():
    response = requests.get("https://api.external-service.com")
    assert response.status_code == 200

def test_external_service():
    check_external_service()
```

Running this with pytest and rerun flags:

```bash
pytest test_example.py --reruns 3
```

This command will rerun `test_external_service` up to three times if it fails initially.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

1. **Excessive Reruns**: If you notice that tests are consistently needing multiple reruns to pass, it might be indicative of underlying stability issues with your code or external dependencies. Review your code and dependencies for potential improvements.
   
2. **Misconfiguration**: Ensure that your CI/CD pipeline configuration files are correctly set up for retries. A common mistake is misplacing or incorrectly formatting the `--reruns` flag.
   
3. **Dependencies on External Services**: Tests dependent on external services can be more prone to flakiness due to factors outside your control. Consider mocking these services during tests when possible.

By understanding and properly configuring the test retry mechanism in MorningAI's development workflow, teams can significantly improve their productivity and focus on delivering high-quality features without being bogged down by flaky tests.
