# System Architecture of MorningAI

MorningAI leverages a robust, scalable system architecture designed to facilitate autonomous agent systems for code generation, FAQ generation, documentation management, and multi-platform integration. This architecture supports real-time task orchestration and vector memory storage, ensuring efficient performance and reliability. Below is an overview of the key components and how they interconnect within the MorningAI platform.

## Key Components

### Frontend

- **Technology Stack**: React with Vite for building highly efficient and fast web applications. TailwindCSS is used for styling, offering utility-first CSS that enables rapid UI development.
- **Path in Repository**: `frontend/`
- **Code Example**:
    ```jsx
    import React from 'react';
    import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
    import './index.css';
    import App from './App';

    ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
    ```
  
### Backend

- **Technology Stack**: Python with Flask serving as the web framework, and Gunicorn as the WSGI HTTP server with multi-worker support for handling requests.
- **Path in Repository**: `backend/`
- **Code Example**:
    ```python
    from flask import Flask
    app = Flask(__name__)

    @app.route('/')
    def hello_world():
        return 'Hello, World!'
    
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        app.run()
    ```

### Database

- **Technology**: PostgreSQL, facilitated by Supabase which adds real-time capabilities and Row Level Security (RLS) for enhanced data protection.
- **Path in Repository**: Not directly applicable as database configurations are managed through Supabase UI or API settings.

### Queue System

- **Technology Stack**: Redis Queue (RQ) is used for managing background tasks with worker heartbeat monitoring to ensure task reliability.
- **Path in Repository**: `queue/`
  
### Orchestration

- **Tool**: LangGraph for orchestrating agent workflows, enabling complex task management and automation.
  
### AI Integration

- **Technology Stack**: OpenAI GPT-4 for content generation, providing advanced natural language processing capabilities.
  
### Deployment

- **Service**: Render.com is used for deployment with continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) practices to streamline updates and maintenance.

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

1. **Frontend Issues**: Ensure all dependencies are up-to-date. Use `npm install` or `yarn install` to update.
2. **Backend Connection Errors**: Verify that Gunicorn is correctly configured with Flask and that environment variables are properly set.
3. **Database Connectivity**: Check if Row Level Security policies are correctly applied without overly restrictive rules that might block legitimate queries.
4. **Queue Processing Delays**: Monitor the RQ dashboard for failed jobs and investigate logs for specific errors. Ensure Redis server health.
5. **Deployment Failures on Render.com**: Review build logs on Render.com and ensure all environment variables are correctly set according to your project's requirements.

This architecture ensures that MorningAI remains scalable, efficient, and capable of handling complex operations across different platforms.
