# Testing Sentry Trace ID in MorningAI

This FAQ entry aims to guide developers through the process of testing and validating Sentry `trace_id` within the MorningAI platform. Sentry is a powerful tool for error tracking and monitoring that helps developers identify, fix, and optimize the performance of their applications. Understanding how to test and work with `trace_id` is crucial for effective debugging and monitoring.

## Understanding Sentry Trace ID

Sentry uses `trace_id` to track and aggregate errors, performance issues, and monitor the health of applications. It is a unique identifier for each request or transaction, making it easier to trace specific issues across distributed systems.

### How to Test Sentry Trace ID in MorningAI

Testing the Sentry `trace_id` involves generating a scenario where Sentry can capture an error or performance issue, then validating the `trace_id` that corresponds to this event.

#### Step 1: Configuration

Ensure your MorningAI project is correctly set up with Sentry. This involves:

- Integrating Sentry SDK into your application.
- Configuring your DSN (Data Source Name) in your environment variables.

For a Flask application within MorningAI, your configuration might look like this:

```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.flask import FlaskIntegration

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="your_sentry_dsn_here",
    integrations=[FlaskIntegration()]
)
```

This code should be placed in your main application file, for example, `/backend/app.py`.

#### Step 2: Generating an Error or Transaction

To test the trace ID, you need to generate an error or a transaction. For testing purposes, you can create a route that triggers an error:

```python
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/trigger-error')
def trigger_error():
    division_by_zero = 1 / 0  # This will cause a ZeroDivisionError
    return "This should not appear"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()
```

#### Step 3: Capturing the Trace ID

When the above endpoint is accessed, Sentry captures the error along with its `trace_id`. To find this ID:

1. Go to your Sentry dashboard.
2. Locate the error event that corresponds to your test.
3. Find the `trace_id` in the event details.

### Common Troubleshooting Tips

- **Missing Errors in Sentry**: Ensure that your DSN is correctly configured and that your internet connection allows communication with Sentry's servers.
- **Incorrect Trace IDs**: Make sure there's no issue with overlapping or reused trace IDs by validating the uniqueness of each request or transaction.
- **Delay in Error Reporting**: Sentry might have a slight delay in displaying events due to processing times. Wait a few minutes and refresh your dashboard.

By following these steps and utilizing the provided tips, developers should be able to effectively test and validate Sentry `trace_id`s within their MorningAI projects, enhancing their ability to monitor and debug their applications.
