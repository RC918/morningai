# Test Retry Mechanism in MorningAI

In the context of software development, ensuring the reliability and robustness of your application is paramount. The MorningAI platform incorporates a sophisticated test retry mechanism designed to enhance the stability of your automated testing processes. This FAQ entry aims to provide developers with a deep understanding of how to utilize this mechanism effectively within the MorningAI platform.

## Understanding Test Retry Mechanism

The test retry mechanism in MorningAI allows tests that fail during a test run to be automatically retried, ensuring that transient issues such as network instability or temporary service unavailability do not lead to false negatives in your testing results. This feature is particularly useful in continuous integration (CI) environments, where tests need to run reliably under various conditions.

### Configuration

To configure test retries, you must modify your project's testing configuration file. Here is an example for a Python-based project using pytest:

```python
# pytest.ini or conftest.py
def pytest_configure(config):
    # Set the number of retries to 2
    config.addinivalue_line("reruns", 2)
    # Delay between retries in seconds
    config.addinivalue_line("reruns_delay", 5)
```

This configuration snippet instructs pytest to retry any failed test up to 2 times with a delay of 5 seconds between each attempt.

### Implementing in CI Pipeline

To integrate test retries within your CI pipeline in Render.com, you can add a step in your `render.yaml` file as follows:

```yaml
- name: Run tests with retry
  run: pytest --reruns 2 --reruns-delay 5
```

This ensures that your CI pipeline utilizes the retry mechanism whenever tests are executed.

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

- **Tests Still Failing After Retries**: If tests continue to fail even after retries, it's crucial to investigate if there's an underlying persistent issue with the codebase or external dependencies.
- **Test Retry Delays**: Ensure that the delay between retries is sufficient for transient issues to resolve themselves. Adjusting the delay based on external dependencies' average recovery time can be beneficial.
- **Resource Utilization**: Be mindful of resource utilization in CI environments when using retries extensively. Each retry consumes additional resources, which might impact overall CI pipeline performance.

By leveraging the test retry mechanism within MorningAI, developers can significantly increase their testing process's resilience and reliability, reducing false negatives and improving confidence in build stability.
