# Testing Sentry `trace_id` in MorningAI

In the context of MorningAI, integrating and testing Sentry's `trace_id` is crucial for tracking and diagnosing issues across the platform's services. This FAQ entry aims to provide developers with an understanding of how to test Sentry `trace_id` within the MorningAI platform, ensuring seamless monitoring and debugging.

## Understanding `trace_id` in Sentry

Sentry uses `trace_id` as part of its distributed tracing system to monitor and troubleshoot performance issues. The `trace_id` helps in correlating events and transactions across different services in a distributed system like MorningAI. It is essential for identifying root causes of issues and understanding the performance characteristics of the platform.

## How to Test Sentry `trace_id`

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have access to the MorningAI repository: RC918/morningai.
- Sentry SDK should be configured in your project. Refer to Sentry's official documentation for setup instructions: [Sentry SDK Setup](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/).

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Integration with MorningAI**

   First, ensure that Sentry is integrated into the MorningAI application. In your Flask application (typically found at `/backend/app.py`), you should initialize Sentry as follows:

   ```python
   import sentry_sdk
   from sentry_sdk.integrations.flask import FlaskIntegration

   sentry_sdk.init(
       dsn="your_sentry_dsn_here",
       integrations=[FlaskIntegration()],
       traces_sample_rate=1.0 # Adjust sampling rate as needed
   )
   ```

2. **Generating a Transaction with `trace_id`**

   To test the `trace_id`, create a simple endpoint that triggers a transaction logged to Sentry. Here's an example:

   ```python
   from flask import Flask, jsonify
   from sentry_sdk import start_transaction

   app = Flask(__name__)

   @app.route('/test-sentry')
   def test_sentry():
       with start_transaction(op="test", name="Test Sentry"):
           # Simulate some operations here
           return jsonify(success=True)

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       app.run(debug=True)
   ```

3. **Viewing the `trace_id`**

   After triggering the endpoint, go to your Sentry dashboard. You should be able to see the transaction under the "Performance" tab. Clicking on the transaction will reveal details, including the `trace_id`.

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

- **Transactions Not Appearing**: If transactions are not appearing in your Sentry dashboard, check your `traces_sample_rate`. A low rate might prevent transactions from being sampled.
- **Incorrect Configuration**: Ensure that your DSN is correctly configured and that you're using the correct version of the Sentry SDK compatible with your project dependencies.
- **Network Issues**: Sentry requires an internet connection to send data. Ensure your development environment has access to the internet or that network policies are not blocking communication with Sentry servers.

By following these steps and tips, developers should be able to effectively integrate and test Sentry's `trace_id` within their instances of MorningAI, aiding in better monitoring and debugging processes.
