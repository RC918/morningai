# E2E Test FAQ for MorningAI

End-to-End (E2E) testing is a critical component of the development process for MorningAI, ensuring that the application behaves as expected from the user's perspective. This FAQ aims to guide developers through the process of creating, running, and troubleshooting E2E tests within the MorningAI platform.

## Understanding E2E Testing in MorningAI

E2E testing involves simulating real user scenarios to verify that the entire flow of MorningAI, from its front end to its back end and all integrated services, works as intended. For MorningAI, this encompasses testing interactions across its autonomous agent system, documentation management features, multi-platform integration, and more.

### Code Example: Setting Up an E2E Test

Below is a basic example of setting up an E2E test in MorningAI using Python with Selenium for web UI testing:

```python
from selenium import webdriver

def test_homepage_loads_correctly():
    # Path to your WebDriver executable
    driver = webdriver.Chrome('/path/to/chromedriver')
    
    # Target URL
    driver.get('http://localhost:3000')
    
    assert "MorningAI" in driver.title
    
    # Cleanup
    driver.quit()
```

This code snippet launches a Chrome browser, loads the homepage of the MorningAI application running locally, checks if the title contains "MorningAI", and then closes the browser.

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

### Test Fails to Find Elements

If your test fails because it cannot find elements on the page, ensure that:

- The page has fully loaded before attempting to find elements. Use explicit waits or assertions to confirm page load.
- Your selectors are correct and specific enough to locate the element.

### Flaky Tests Due to Timing Issues

Flakiness in tests often results from timing issues where actions occur before the app is ready or in an inconsistent state. To mitigate this:

- Use explicit waits rather than fixed sleep times.
- Ensure consistent test data by resetting the database or mock data before each test run.

### WebDriver Executable Not Found

If you encounter errors stating that the WebDriver executable cannot be found, check that:

- The path to your WebDriver executable is correct in your test script.
- The WebDriver version matches your browser version.

## Conclusion

E2E testing is pivotal for maintaining high-quality standards in MorningAI. By following best practices and utilizing provided examples and documentation links, developers can effectively write and troubleshoot E2E tests, ensuring robustness and reliability across MorningAI's functionalities.
