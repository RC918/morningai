# Testing Sentry Trace ID in MorningAI

Understanding and utilizing Sentry's `trace_id` is crucial for monitoring and debugging the MorningAI platform. Sentry provides application monitoring that enables developers to identify, triage, and resolve issues with greater efficiency. The `trace_id` is a unique identifier used to track the flow of a request or a job through various parts of the system.

## Explanation

In MorningAI, when an error or performance issue occurs, Sentry captures it along with a `trace_id`. This ID can be used to trace the event back through the system to understand what happened and where. It's particularly useful in a distributed system like MorningAI, where requests pass through multiple services and components.

### How to Use `trace_id` in MorningAI

To test or utilize the `trace_id` within the MorningAI platform, follow these steps:

1. **Integrate Sentry**: Ensure Sentry is integrated into your MorningAI application. This typically involves adding the Sentry SDK to your project and configuring it with your DSN (Data Source Name).

2. **Generate Errors or Transactions**: To test trace IDs, you need errors or transactions. In development, you can manually generate errors or use automated tests.

3. **Retrieve the `trace_id`**: When an error occurs, Sentry captures it along with its `trace_id`. This ID can be found in the Sentry issue details page.

### Code Example

Here's a basic example of how to integrate Sentry into a Flask app within MorningAI:

```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.flask import FlaskIntegration

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="your_sentry_dsn_here",
    integrations=[FlaskIntegration()],
    traces_sample_rate=1.0 # Adjust sampling rate as needed
)

# Example Flask app
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    raise ValueError("Testing Sentry trace_id")  # Force an error to test Sentry integration

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

Replace `"your_sentry_dsn_here"` with your actual DSN from Sentry.

### Common Troubleshooting Tips

**Issue**: Missing `trace_id` in Sentry events.
- **Solution**: Ensure that tracing is enabled and properly configured in your Sentry SDK setup. Check the `traces_sample_rate` configuration.

**Issue**: Errors not appearing in Sentry.
- **Solution**:
  - Verify your network connectivity.
  - Confirm that your DSN is correctly configured in your application.
  - Ensure there are no issues with your Sentry project settings.

**Issue**: High volume of irrelevant data.
- **Solution**: Adjust your sampling rate (`traces_sample_rate`) to capture fewer transactions, focusing on the most critical parts of your application.
