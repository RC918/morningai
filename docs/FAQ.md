# System Architecture of MorningAI

MorningAI is built on a modern, scalable, and flexible architecture designed to handle the complexities of autonomous agent system operations, FAQ generation, documentation management, and multi-platform integration. Our system leverages a combination of cutting-edge technologies and methodologies to ensure high performance, reliability, and ease of use.

## Overview

The core components of MorningAI's architecture include:

- **Frontend**: Developed with React, utilizing Vite as the build tool and TailwindCSS for styling. This setup offers a fast development experience and a responsive user interface.
- **Backend**: Powered by Python with Flask as the web framework and Gunicorn serving as the WSGI HTTP Server with multi-worker support for handling concurrent requests efficiently.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL is used for data storage, augmented with Supabase for added functionalities like Row Level Security (RLS), providing robust data access controls.
- **Queue System**: Redis Queue (RQ) is employed for task queuing to manage background jobs effectively, with worker heartbeat monitoring to ensure reliability.
- **Orchestration**: LangGraph is used for orchestrating agent workflows, enabling complex task management and execution flows.
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI's GPT-4 is integrated for generating content dynamically, powering our FAQ generation and autonomous code generation features.
- **Deployment**: Hosted on Render.com with continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines set up for streamlined updates.

### Frontend Architecture

```jsx
// Example: src/App.jsx
import React from 'react';
import 'tailwindcss/tailwind.css';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <header className="bg-blue-500 text-white p-4">MorningAI Dashboard</header>
      {/* Content goes here */}
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

### Backend Setup

```python
# Example: app.py
from flask import Flask
from flask_cors import CORS

app = Flask(__name__)
CORS(app)

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello, World from MorningAI!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

### Database Configuration

To integrate PostgreSQL with Row Level Security via Supabase:

```sql
-- Enable RLS on a table
ALTER TABLE your_table ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Add policies as needed
CREATE POLICY your_policy ON your_table FOR SELECT USING (user_id = current_user_id());
```

### Task Queuing with Redis Queue

```python
# Example: task_queue.py
from redis import Redis
from rq import Queue

redis_conn = Redis()
q = Queue(connection=redis_conn)

def background_task(args):
    # Task implementation here
    pass

# Enqueueing a task
job = q.enqueue(background_task, args=(your_args,))
```

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

**1. Frontend Build Issues**: Ensure all node modules are correctly installed (`npm install`) and check for version compatibility in `package.json`.

**2. Backend Server Errors**: Verify environment variables are correctly set up for database connections and third-party integrations.

**3. Database Connection Failures**: Check the database URL and credentials in the `.env` file or Supabase dashboard. Ensure network rules allow connections from your application's IP address.

**4. Task Queuing Delays or Failures**: Monitor Redis server health and queue dashboards. Ensure workers are running and have network access to the Redis server.

**5. Deployment Failures on Render.com**: Review build logs on Render.com for specific error messages. Ensure `render.yaml` configuration matches your project's requirements.
