# Test Retry Mechanism in MorningAI

The MorningAI platform incorporates a robust test retry mechanism designed to enhance the stability and reliability of the codebase. This feature is particularly crucial for dealing with flaky tests or external services that might occasionally fail due to network issues or other transient problems. This document provides a comprehensive overview of how to understand and utilize the test retry mechanism within the MorningAI project.

## Understanding Test Retry Mechanism

The test retry mechanism in MorningAI automatically re-runs failed tests before marking them as failures. This approach helps mitigate issues caused by temporary conditions such as network latency, dependent services' downtime, or random test failures, thus improving overall test suite reliability.

### How It Works

When a test fails during the execution of the test suite, the retry mechanism triggers an automatic re-run of the failed test based on predefined criteria such as maximum retry attempts and delay intervals between retries. This process continues until the test passes or the maximum number of retries is reached.

### Configuration

The retry mechanism is configured in the project's testing framework settings. For Python projects like MorningAI, this can be handled via a testing framework like `pytest` with plugins such as `pytest-rerunfailures`.

```python
# In pytest.ini or conftest.py
pytest_plugins = ['rerunfailures']
def pytest_addoption(parser):
    parser.addoption("--reruns", action="repeat", default=3,
                     help="Number of times to rerun failed tests")
```

This example configures `pytest` to retry failed tests up to three times.

## Code Example

Here's how you might use it in a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions workflow) for MorningAI:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/python-app.yml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v2
        with:
          python-version: '3.8'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          pip install -r requirements.txt
      - name: Run tests with retries
        run: |
          pytest --reruns 3
```

This configuration ensures that if any test fails, `pytest` will automatically attempt to re-run it up to three times.

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

- **Tests still failing after retries**: Investigate if the issue is due to persistent code bugs or environment setup rather than transient problems.
- **Retry mechanism not triggering**: Ensure that your testing framework and any necessary plugins are correctly installed and configured.
- **Excessive build times**: If retries are causing your build times to significantly increase, consider adjusting the retry count or investigating more stable solutions for flaky tests.
