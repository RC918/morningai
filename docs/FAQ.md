# Testing Sentry Trace ID in MorningAI

Sentry is an error tracking tool that helps developers monitor and fix crashes in real time. The `trace_id` is a unique identifier for each transaction or error, allowing developers to trace the source of an issue across services and components within the MorningAI platform.

## Understanding Sentry `trace_id`

Each transaction or error captured by Sentry is assigned a `trace_id`. This ID is critical for debugging purposes as it helps in identifying and tracing back the exact sequence of events leading to an error. In a multi-service architecture like MorningAI, where different components interact through network calls, having a `trace_id` simplifies pinpointing where things went wrong.

### How to Use `trace_id` in MorningAI

MorningAI integrates Sentry for its robust error tracking and monitoring capabilities. To utilize the `trace_id`, follow these steps:

1. **Integration Setup**: Ensure Sentry SDK is properly integrated into your service. For Flask applications within MorningAI (e.g., located at `/backend`), you might have something like this:

    ```python
    import sentry_sdk
    from sentry_sdk.integrations.flask import FlaskIntegration
    
    sentry_sdk.init(
        dsn="your_sentry_dsn_here",
        integrations=[FlaskIntegration()]
    )
    ```

2. **Capturing Errors with Trace ID**: When an exception occurs, Sentry automatically captures the error along with its `trace_id`. This can be viewed in the Sentry dashboard under the specific project for MorningAI.

3. **Logging with Trace ID**: For more granular tracking, especially for debugging complex workflows, you can manually log messages with trace IDs:

    ```python
    from sentry_sdk import capture_message
    
    capture_message('Something important happened!', level='info')
    ```

   To include a `trace_id`, you may need to extract it from the current context and add it as part of your log message or as an additional tag/context.

### Common Troubleshooting Tips

- **Missing Trace IDs**: Ensure that the Sentry SDK is initialized early in your application's startup sequence. Late initialization can lead to missing context and trace IDs for early errors.
- **Incorrect DSN Configuration**: Verify that your DSN (Data Source Name) is correctly configured in your environment variables or application configuration file. An incorrect DSN will prevent errors from being reported to Sentry.
- **Network Issues**: Sentry requires a stable internet connection to send error reports. Ensure your deployment environment has reliable connectivity.
- **Sentry Rate Limits**: Be aware of any rate limits on your Sentry account which might be causing some errors not to be reported.

For more detailed information on configuring and using Sentry within MorningAI, refer to the official documentation and ensure your setup aligns with best practices for monitoring and error tracking in a multi-service architecture.
