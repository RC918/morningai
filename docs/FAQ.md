# MorningAI System Architecture

MorningAI employs a robust, scalable architecture designed to facilitate efficient autonomous code generation, documentation management, and multi-platform integration. This architecture leverages a combination of modern technologies and practices to ensure high performance, reliability, and ease of use.

## Overview

The system's architecture is built around a core set of components, each serving a distinct role within the platform:

- **Frontend**: Developed using React, Vite, and TailwindCSS, the frontend provides a responsive and intuitive user interface. It communicates with the backend through RESTful APIs or WebSocket connections for real-time interactions.
  
- **Backend**: The backend is powered by Python with Flask as the web framework and Gunicorn serving as the HTTP server with multi-worker support. This setup ensures efficient handling of concurrent requests and seamless scalability.

- **Database**: PostgreSQL, enhanced with Row Level Security (RLS) for data protection, serves as the primary database. It is hosted on Supabase, which provides additional features like authentication and real-time subscriptions.

- **Queue System**: Redis Queue (RQ) is utilized for task management and orchestration. It allows for asynchronous execution of tasks, such as code generation processes or integrations with external services.

- **Orchestration**: LangGraph is used for managing agent workflows. It facilitates complex task sequences and dependencies among various services within the platform.

- **AI Integration**: OpenAI's GPT-4 powers the content generation features, including FAQ generation and autonomous code suggestions.

- **Deployment**: The entire platform is deployed on Render.com, benefiting from its CI/CD capabilities for streamlined updates and maintenance.

## Code Examples

### Backend Flask Setup

```python
from flask import Flask
from flask_cors import CORS

app = Flask(__name__)
CORS(app)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

### RQ Task Example

```python
from redis import Redis
from rq import Queue

q = Queue(connection=Redis())

def background_task(arg):
    print(f"Running task with argument {arg}")
    # Task implementation here

job = q.enqueue(background_task, 'example')
```

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

**Issue**: Backend service not responding  
**Solution**: Check if Gunicorn is properly configured with workers. Ensure that there are no errors in your Flask application that could prevent it from starting.

**Issue**: Tasks not being processed by Redis Queue  
**Solution**: Verify that RQ workers are running and connected to the correct Redis instance. Check for any failed jobs in the RQ dashboard and examine their error messages for clues.

**Issue**: Database connection errors  
**Solution**: Ensure that your Supabase credentials are correct and that your IP is allowed to connect if you have IP-based restrictions enabled. Review PostgreSQL logs for specific error messages.
