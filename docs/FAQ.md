# Testing Sentry Trace ID in MorningAI

When integrating Sentry into your applications for error tracking and performance monitoring, it's crucial to ensure that the Sentry `trace_id` is correctly generated and propagated through your system. This ensures that errors and performance issues can be accurately traced back to their source, making debugging and monitoring more effective. This FAQ aims to guide developers on how to test the Sentry `trace_id` within the MorningAI platform.

## Understanding Sentry `trace_id`

The Sentry `trace_id` is a unique identifier for each request or operation within your system. It ties together events, transactions, and errors, allowing you to trace the path of a request across service boundaries. This is particularly useful in distributed systems where requests pass through multiple services.

## How to Test Sentry `trace_id` in MorningAI

To test the generation and propagation of the Sentry `trace_id` in MorningAI, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Configuration

Ensure that Sentry is correctly configured in your application. In a Flask application like MorningAI, this typically involves initializing the Sentry SDK with your DSN (Data Source Name) and configuring any relevant options.

```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.flask import FlaskIntegration

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="your_sentry_dsn_here",
    integrations=[FlaskIntegration()],
    traces_sample_rate=1.0 # Adjust sampling rate as needed
)
```

### Step 2: Generating Transactions

In MorningAI, when you want to test tracing, you can manually create a transaction. This can be done around an operation or request handler where you wish to monitor performance or trace errors.

```python
from sentry_sdk import start_transaction

@app.route("/some_endpoint")
def some_view_function():
    with start_transaction(op="task", name="Some Task"):
        # Your code here
        pass
```

This manually creates a transaction for the given block of code, which will include a `trace_id`.

### Step 3: Verifying Trace ID

After configuring Sentry and wrapping your code with transactions, perform operations that trigger these pieces of code. Then, check your Sentry dashboard for incoming transactions and errors. Each transaction/error will have a `trace_id` associated with it.

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

- **Transactions not appearing**: Ensure that the `traces_sample_rate` is set to a value greater than 0. Also, check network issues that might prevent data from being sent to Sentry.
- **Incorrect `trace_id` association**: Make sure that manual transactions are correctly wrapped around the code blocks you wish to trace. Incorrect nesting can lead to misleading traces.
- **Performance overhead**: While testing, setting `traces_sample_rate` to 1.0 captures all transactions but might introduce overhead. Adjust this value based on your production needs.

Testing the Sentry `trace_id` functionality within MorningAI involves configuring Sentry correctly, wrapping key operations within transactions, and verifying through the Sentry dashboard that these transactions are correctly reported with their unique trace identifiers.
