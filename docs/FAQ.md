# Test Retry Mechanism in MorningAI

When developing and running tests in a continuous integration (CI) environment, it's common to encounter flaky tests that fail intermittently due to reasons like network instability, external service downtime, or race conditions. MorningAI incorporates a retry mechanism for tests to enhance the robustness of our CI pipeline and reduce manual intervention due to non-deterministic failures.

## Understanding Test Retries

Test retries are designed to automatically re-run failed tests before marking them as truly failed. This mechanism can significantly improve the stability of automated test suites by giving transient failures a chance to pass on subsequent attempts.

### Configuration

MorningAI uses a configurable test retry strategy, which can be adjusted in the test configuration file (`test_config.yml` or similar). Here is an example configuration:

```yaml
# test_config.yml
tests:
  retry:
    max_attempts: 3
    delay: 2 # Delay in seconds between attempts
```

This configuration will attempt to run each failed test up to three times with a two-second pause between each attempt.

### Code Example

In the context of MorningAI's Python-based backend, utilizing Flask and Gunicorn with Redis Queue for task orchestration, implementing a retry mechanism for a specific test could look something like this:

```python
import unittest
from myapp import my_function
from retrying import retry

def is_retryable_exception(exception):
    """Define your logic to decide if the exception should trigger a retry."""
    return isinstance(exception, TemporaryNetworkError)

@retry(retry_on_exception=is_retryable_exception, stop_max_attempt_number=3, wait_fixed=2000)
def test_my_function():
    """Example test function that will be retried upon specific exceptions."""
    assert my_function() == expected_output

class MyTestCase(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_example(self):
        test_my_function()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

1. **Ensure Idempotency**: Make sure that the tests and the operations they perform are idempotent. Re-running a test should not create side-effects that could cause subsequent runs to fail or pass incorrectly.
2. **Correct Exception Handling**: Verify that retries are triggered by the correct types of exceptions. Misconfiguration could lead to unnecessary retries or missed retry opportunities.
3. **Monitor and Analyze Failures**: Regularly review the logs for retried tests. Persistent flakiness might indicate deeper issues that require attention beyond just re-running tests.
4. **Resource Cleanup**: Especially in integration tests involving databases or external services, ensure proper cleanup after each attempt to avoid polluted state affecting retries.

Implementing and configuring a robust test retry mechanism is crucial for maintaining an efficient and reliable CI/CD pipeline in MorningAI's development workflow. By understanding how to utilize this feature effectively, developers can minimize disruptions caused by flaky tests and focus on delivering high-quality code.
