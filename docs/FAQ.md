# Handling MorningAI During a Redis Outage

When experiencing a Redis outage, it's crucial for developers using MorningAI to understand how to manage the situation effectively. This guide provides comprehensive information on steps to take, code examples where applicable, and troubleshooting tips.

## Overview

MorningAI utilizes Redis Queue (RQ) for task orchestration and real-time job processing. A Redis outage can halt task processing, affecting the autonomous agent system and real-time task orchestration features of the platform.

### Steps to Follow During an Outage

1. **Identify the Outage:** Confirm that the issue is with Redis by checking the Redis service status or logs.
   
   ```bash
   # Example command to check Redis status
   systemctl status redis
   ```

2. **Enable Maintenance Mode (if applicable):** Temporarily disable new task submissions to prevent job queue pile-up.

3. **Notify Users:** Inform users of the outage and provide an estimated timeline for resolution.

4. **Engage Failover Procedures:** If configured, switch to a standby Redis instance.

5. **Monitor and Resolve:** Keep an eye on system logs and Redis metrics while working on resolving the outage issue.

### Code Snippets for Managing Tasks During an Outage

- **Pause Task Submission:**
  To temporarily halt task submission, you might want to add a maintenance mode check before enqueuing tasks in your Flask application:

  ```python
  from flask import Flask, jsonify
  import os

  app = Flask(__name__)

  @app.route('/enqueue', methods=['POST'])
  def enqueue_task():
      if os.getenv('MAINTENANCE_MODE') == 'true':
          return jsonify({'error': 'The system is currently under maintenance.'}), 503
      # Logic to enqueue task goes here
      return jsonify({'status': 'success'}), 200
  ```

- **Switching to Standby Redis Instance:**
  Ensure your application configuration supports easy switching between primary and standby Redis instances:

  ```python
  import redis
  from rq import Queue

  # Function to connect to Redis
  def get_redis_connection():
      try:
          # Try connecting to primary Redis instance
          return redis.Redis(host='primary_redis_host', port=6379)
      except redis.RedisError:
          # Fallback to standby instance in case of an error
          return redis.Redis(host='standby_redis_host', port=6379)

  q = Queue(connection=get_redis_connection())
  ```

### Troubleshooting Tips

1. **Check Redis Logs:** Often, the cause of an outage can be identified in the logs.
   
   ```bash
   # Example command to view Redis logs
   tail -f /var/log/redis/redis-server.log
   ```

2. **Ensure Adequate Resources:** Verify that the Redis server has enough memory and CPU resources available.

3. **Network Issues:** Confirm there are no network connectivity issues between your application servers and the Redis server.

4. **Redis Configuration:** Review your Redis configuration files for any misconfigurations that could lead to performance issues or outages.

Remember, effective communication within your team and with your users is key during any outage. Keeping everyone informed helps manage expectations and reduces frustration.
