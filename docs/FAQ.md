# Test Retry Mechanism in MorningAI

The test retry mechanism in MorningAI is designed to enhance the reliability and robustness of the platform by automatically reattempting failed tests before marking them as failures. This feature is particularly useful in distributed systems where transient issues such as network latency, temporary service disruptions, or resource contention can cause tests to fail intermittently. Implementing a retry mechanism ensures that only genuinely failing tests are flagged, reducing noise and improving the accuracy of test results.

## Understanding the Test Retry Mechanism

MorningAI utilizes a sophisticated retry logic that can be customized to fit various testing scenarios. The mechanism is built into the CI/CD pipeline, ensuring that any test failure triggers a retry based on predefined rules such as the maximum number of attempts and delay intervals between retries.

### Code Example: Configuring Test Retries

To configure test retries in MorningAI, you would typically adjust settings in your CI/CD configuration file or within your testing framework. Below is an example using Python's `unittest` framework with a hypothetical `retry` decorator that demonstrates how you might implement retries for a specific test:

```python
import unittest
from retrying import retry

def retry_if_result_false(result):
    return result is False

class MyTestCase(unittest.TestCase):
    @retry(retry_on_result=retry_if_result_false, stop_max_attempt_number=3, wait_fixed=2000)
    def test_with_retry(self):
        # Your test code here
        result = perform_some_operation()
        self.assertTrue(result)
```

This example uses the `retrying` library to add a retry mechanism to a test case, specifying that the test should be retried up to three times (with a two-second pause between attempts) if the result is not `True`.

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

When implementing or debugging the test retry mechanism in MorningAI, consider these common issues:

1. **Incorrect Configuration**: Ensure that your retry configurations (e.g., maximum attempts, delay intervals) are correctly set up in your CI/CD pipeline or testing framework.
2. **Identifying Flaky Tests**: Use logging or reporting tools to identify tests that frequently require retries. Investigating these can uncover underlying instability in your application or environment.
3. **Dependency on External Services**: If your tests depend on external services, ensure those services are reliable during testing or consider mocking them.
4. **Resource Saturation**: Be aware that introducing retries without proper backoff strategies can lead to resource saturation (e.g., overwhelming APIs with requests), exacerbating the problem.

Remember, while retries can mitigate the impact of flaky tests, they are not a substitute for investigating and addressing the root causes of those failures.
