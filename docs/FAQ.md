# Test Retry Success in MorningAI

Ensuring the reliability and resilience of applications is a critical aspect of software development. In MorningAI, the capability to retry tests upon failure is an essential feature that aids developers in identifying flaky tests and ensuring that transient issues do not lead to false negatives in test results. This document aims to guide developers through the process of utilizing test retries within the MorningAI platform, helping to improve the stability and accuracy of their testing processes.

## Understanding Test Retries

Test retries are a mechanism that allows test executions to be automatically repeated in case of failures. This can be particularly useful in distributed systems where network latency, temporary unavailability of services, or other ephemeral issues can cause tests to fail intermittently. By retrying a failed test, we can distinguish between persistent failures caused by actual bugs and transient failures that do not indicate a real problem with the code.

### Configuration

To enable test retries in MorningAI, you will need to modify your test configuration files. Depending on the test framework you are using (e.g., pytest, unittest), this process may vary. Here is an example using pytest with the `pytest-rerunfailures` plugin:

```python
# pytest.ini file
[pytest]
addopts = --reruns 3 --reruns-delay 5
```

This configuration tells pytest to rerun failed tests up to three times with a delay of five seconds between each attempt.

### Implementation Example

Assuming you are using Flask for your backend and pytest for testing, here's how you can set up a basic retry mechanism for a simple API endpoint test:

```python
import requests

def test_get_user_retry():
    max_retries = 3
    for _ in range(max_retries):
        response = requests.get("http://localhost:5000/api/user/1")
        if response.status_code == 200:
            break
    assert response.status_code == 200
```

While this example uses a simple loop for retries, integrating with a testing framework's retry mechanism (as shown in the configuration section) is recommended for more sophisticated scenarios.

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

- **Ensure Correct Configuration**: Double-check your testing framework's documentation to ensure your retry configuration is correct.
- **Network Stability**: In cases where tests interact with external services, ensure network stability to minimize transient errors.
- **Dependency Mocking**: For external service calls, consider mocking these dependencies in your tests to avoid failures due to issues outside your control.
- **Logging**: Implement detailed logging within both your application and tests to help identify why tests might be flaky or failing intermittently.

By carefully implementing and configuring test retries within MorningAI, developers can significantly reduce the impact of flaky tests on their CI/CD pipeline, leading to more reliable software delivery processes.
