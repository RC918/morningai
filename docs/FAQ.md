# Handling Redis Outage in MorningAI

When a Redis outage occurs, it can significantly impact the functionality of MorningAI, especially features relying on real-time task orchestration and queue management. This FAQ aims to provide developers with insights and strategies to manage and mitigate issues arising from a Redis outage.

## Understanding the Impact of a Redis Outage

Redis, being an in-memory data store, is crucial for managing background jobs and real-time operations in MorningAI. An outage can lead to:
- Delayed or failed execution of autonomous agent tasks.
- Inaccessibility of real-time task orchestration.
- Potential loss of transient data stored in Redis queues.

### Code Example: Monitoring Redis Health

To monitor Redis health and implement a basic health check, you can use the following Python snippet:

```python
import redis
from flask import Flask, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)
redis_client = redis.Redis(host='localhost', port=6379, db=0)

@app.route('/health/redis')
def check_redis():
    try:
        redis_client.ping()
        return jsonify(status="success", message="Redis is up"), 200
    except redis.exceptions.ConnectionError:
        return jsonify(status="error", message="Failed to connect to Redis"), 500

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

This endpoint can be added to your Flask application to quickly assess the status of your Redis connection.

## Strategies for Mitigating Redis Outage Effects

1. **Implementing Fallback Logic**: Modify your application logic to handle failures gracefully. This could involve queuing tasks in an alternate storage system until Redis is back online.
   
2. **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Introduce a circuit breaker for your Redis interactions. This prevents your system from trying to perform operations when Redis is known to be down.

3. **High Availability Setup**: Use a Redis setup designed for high availability, such as Redis Sentinel or Redis Cluster, to minimize downtime.

4. **Monitoring and Alerts**: Leverage monitoring tools like Prometheus and alerting systems like Alertmanager to get real-time notifications about outages.

### Example: Fallback Mechanism for Task Queuing

Below is a simplified example showing how you could implement a basic fallback mechanism using Python's `try-except` block:

```python
import rq
from redis import Redis
from my_backup_queue_system import backup_enqueue

redis_conn = Redis()

def enqueue_task(task):
    try:
        queue = rq.Queue(connection=redis_conn)
        job = queue.enqueue('my_module.my_function', args=(task,))
        return job.id
    except (rq.exceptions.RQConnectionException, ConnectionError):
        # Fallback to an alternative queuing mechanism
        backup_enqueue('my_module.my_function', args=(task,))
```

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

1. **Verify Connection Parameters**: Ensure that your application's connection parameters for Redis are correct (host, port, password).

2. **Monitor Resources**: Check the system resources on the server hosting Redis. High CPU utilization or memory pressure can cause performance issues.

3. **Check Logs**: Review the logs for both MorningAI and Redis. They can provide clues about the nature of the connectivity issues or errors being encountered.

4. **Redis Configuration**: Review your Redis configuration settings. Incorrect configurations can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior or outages.

5. **Network Issues**: Sometimes, network problems between your application servers and the Redis server can cause apparent "outages." Tools like `ping` or `traceroute` can help diagnose these issues.
