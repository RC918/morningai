# System Architecture of MorningAI

The system architecture of MorningAI is designed to support a scalable, efficient, and robust service for autonomous agent code generation, documentation management, and multi-platform integration. Below is a comprehensive overview of the architecture components and how they interact within the MorningAI platform.

## Overview

MorningAI utilizes a microservices architecture to ensure scalability and flexibility. The key components of this architecture include:

- **Frontend**: Built with React, Vite, and TailwindCSS for a responsive and modern user interface.
- **Backend**: Powered by Python with Flask serving as the web framework and Gunicorn as the WSGI HTTP server for handling requests.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL is used for data storage, enhanced with Row Level Security (RLS) for data protection. Supabase adds real-time capabilities and easy integration.
- **Queue System**: Redis Queue (RQ) facilitates asynchronous task processing, enabling efficient task management and execution.
- **Orchestration**: LangGraph orchestrates agent workflows, ensuring tasks are performed seamlessly across different services.
- **AI Engine**: OpenAI's GPT-4 provides advanced AI capabilities for content generation, including FAQ generation and code suggestions.
- **Deployment**: Render.com is used for hosting, offering CI/CD pipelines for continuous integration and delivery.

## Detailed Architecture

### Frontend

The frontend layer is implemented using React for building the user interface components. Vite serves as the build tool, offering fast rebuilds and Hot Module Replacement (HMR). TailwindCSS is used for styling, enabling rapid UI development.

**Code Example: Initializing a React Component**
```jsx
import React from 'react';
import './App.css';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <header className="App-header">
        MorningAI Dashboard
      </header>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

### Backend

The backend leverages Flask as the web framework to handle HTTP requests. Gunicorn acts as the WSGI server with multi-worker support to manage multiple requests concurrently.

**Code Example: Flask Application Setup**
```python
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello, MorningAI!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

### Database

PostgreSQL is utilized for storing application data, including user information and generated content. Supabase adds additional functionalities such as real-time data updates.

**Connecting to Supabase in Python**
```python
from supabase import create_client, Client

url: str = "your_supabase_url"
key: str = "your_supabase_key"
supabase: Client = create_client(url, key)
```

### Queue System

Redis Queue manages background tasks such as code generation or data processing. This decouples long-running operations from the main application flow.

**Enqueue a Job in RQ**
```python
from redis import Redis
from rq import Queue

q = Queue(connection=Redis())

result = q.enqueue('my_function', arg1, arg2)
```

### Orchestration & AI

LangGraph orchestrates complex workflows involving multiple services. GPT-4 from OpenAI enhances the platform's capabilities by generating high-quality content based on user inputs.

### Deployment

Render.com supports deployment with its integrated CI/CD pipeline, facilitating easy updates and maintenance of the application components.

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

1. **Frontend Not Updating**: Ensure that your browser cache is cleared or use incognito mode to view changes.
2. **Database Connection Issues**: Verify your Supabase URL and keys are correctly configured in your environment variables.
3. **Tasks Not Processing in RQ**: Check if Redis server is running and accessible. Also verify that RQ workers are up and running.
4. **Deployment Failures on Render.com**: Review build logs on Render.com for specific error messages. Common issues include missing environment variables or build commands.

By understanding the system architecture of MorningAI, developers can better navigate the platform, troubleshoot issues effectively, and contribute to its development.
