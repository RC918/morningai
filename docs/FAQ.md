# MorningAI System Architecture

MorningAI leverages a modern, scalable, and robust architecture designed to provide autonomous agent systems for code generation, FAQ generation, documentation management, and multi-platform integration. This document aims to give developers a comprehensive understanding of the system's architecture, facilitating better usage and customization.

## Overview

The architecture of MorningAI is built with efficiency, scalability, and flexibility in mind. It integrates several technologies and frameworks to offer a seamless experience for both developers and end-users. Here's a breakdown of the core components:

### Frontend

- **Technology Stack**: The frontend is developed using React, Vite, and TailwindCSS. This combination allows for fast development cycles and a responsive design that adapts to various devices.
- **Path**: The frontend codebase can be found in `RC918/morningai/frontend`.

#### Code Example

```jsx
// Sample React component in MorningAI
import React from 'react';
import 'tailwindcss/tailwind.css';

function WelcomeBanner() {
  return <div className="text-center p-4 bg-blue-500 text-white">Welcome to MorningAI</div>;
}

export default WelcomeBanner;
```

### Backend

- **Technology Stack**: The backend is powered by Python using Flask as the web framework and Gunicorn as the WSGI HTTP Server with multi-worker support for handling concurrent requests.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL via Supabase with Row Level Security ensures data integrity and security. It also utilizes pgvector for vector memory storage.
- **Path**: Backend services are located under `RC918/morningai/backend`.

#### Code Example

```python
# Simple Flask route in MorningAI
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello, World from MorningAI!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

### Queue System

- **Queue Management**: Redis Queue (RQ) is used for managing background tasks with worker heartbeat monitoring to ensure tasks are completed successfully.
- **Path**: The configuration for RQ can be found under `RC918/morningai/queue`.

### Orchestration and AI

- **Orchestration**: LangGraph is utilized for managing agent workflows efficiently.
- **Artificial Intelligence**: OpenAI's GPT-4 powers the content generation, providing high-quality outputs.
- **Path**: AI models and orchestration logic reside within `RC918/morningai/ai`.

### Deployment

- Hosted on Render.com with continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) setup to streamline updates and maintain system reliability.

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

### Frontend Issues

1. **Issue**: Slow load times during development.
    - **Solution**: Ensure Vite is configured correctly for hot module replacement. Check `vite.config.js` for optimizations.

### Backend Issues

1. **Issue**: Database connectivity issues.
    - **Solution**: Verify the Supabase credentials in your `.env` file. Ensure network ACLs allow connections from your application's IP.

### Queue System Issues

1. **Issue**: Tasks stuck in queue without processing.
    - **Solution**: Check RQ worker logs for errors. Ensure Redis is running and accessible by workers.
