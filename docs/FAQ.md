# System Architecture of MorningAI

MorningAI leverages a sophisticated system architecture designed to efficiently manage and execute autonomous agent tasks, provide real-time task orchestration, and handle multi-platform integration seamlessly. This architecture is vital for developers working with MorningAI, as it influences how applications are built, deployed, and scaled on the platform.

## Overview

At its core, MorningAI's architecture is built around a multi-tenant SaaS model, supporting various services such as code generation by autonomous agents, FAQ generation, documentation management, and seamless integration across popular platforms like Telegram, LINE, and Messenger. The system uses a combination of modern technologies and frameworks to ensure scalability, performance, and ease of use.

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Developed using React with Vite for fast builds and TailwindCSS for styling.
- **Backend**: Python and Flask form the backbone of the server-side logic, with Gunicorn serving as the WSGI HTTP server.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL via Supabase provides robust database management with features like Row Level Security.
- **Queue**: Redis Queue (RQ) is used for managing background tasks with worker heartbeat monitoring to ensure reliability.
- **Orchestration**: LangGraph orchestrates agent workflows efficiently.
- **AI**: OpenAI GPT-4 powers content generation, offering advanced capabilities.
- **Deployment**: Render.com hosts the platform with continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) support for streamlined updates.

### Architecture Diagram

While an explicit diagram isn't provided here, envisioning the system architecture involves understanding how these components interact:

1. **Frontend Interaction**: Users interact with the platform through a React-based UI that communicates with the backend via REST API or GraphQL endpoints.
2. **Backend Processing**: Flask applications process requests, interacting with Redis Queue for task management and Supabase/PostgreSQL for data persistence.
3. **Task Orchestration & Execution**: LangGraph handles task workflows while RQ workers execute tasks asynchronously to prevent blocking user interactions.
4. **AI Integration**: GPT-4 integrates at various points for content generation tasks, leveraging vector memory storage in pgvector/Supabase for efficiency.

### Code Examples

#### Initializing a RQ Worker
```python
from rq import Worker, Queue, Connection
import redis

redis_url = "redis://localhost:6379"
conn = redis.from_url(redis_url)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    with Connection(conn):
        worker = Worker(map(Queue, ['default']))
        worker.work()
```

#### Supabase Integration Sample
```javascript
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js'

const supabaseUrl = 'https://your-supabase-url.supabase.co'
const supabaseKey = 'your-supabase-key'
const supabase = createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseKey)
```

### Common Troubleshooting Tips

**Issue:** RQ Worker Not Processing Jobs  
**Solution:** Ensure Redis server is running and accessible. Check worker logs for errors.

**Issue:** Failed Database Connections  
**Solution:** Verify Supabase credentials and network settings. Ensure your application's IP is allowed if using IP whitelisting.

**Issue:** Frontend Build Errors  
**Solution:** Check `package.json` for correct dependency versions. Ensure Vite configuration aligns with project requirements.
