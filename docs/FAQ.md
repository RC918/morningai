# MorningAI System Architecture

MorningAI leverages a modern, scalable architecture designed to facilitate rapid development and deployment of AI-powered features, including autonomous agent systems for code generation, FAQ generation, documentation management, and multi-platform integration. Below is a comprehensive overview of the system architecture employed in the MorningAI platform.

## Overview

MorningAI's architecture is built with scalability, efficiency, and robustness in mind. It employs a microservices-oriented approach, enabling independent scaling and development of different parts of the system. The core components include:

- **Frontend:** Developed with React, leveraging Vite for build optimization and TailwindCSS for styling.
- **Backend:** Python-based using Flask as the web framework and Gunicorn as the WSGI HTTP Server with multi-worker support for handling concurrent requests efficiently.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL provided by Supabase with Row Level Security (RLS) for enhanced data protection and pgvector for vector memory storage capabilities.
- **Queue System:** Redis Queue (RQ) is used for task queuing to manage background jobs with worker heartbeat monitoring for reliability.
- **Orchestration:** LangGraph is utilized for orchestrating agent workflows, ensuring seamless task execution across different services.
- **AI Integration:** OpenAI's GPT-4 model powers content generation, including code snippets, FAQ answers, and documentation.
- **Deployment:** Render.com hosts the application with continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines to streamline updates.

## Code Examples

### Backend Flask Setup

```python
# File: backend/app.py

from flask import Flask
from flask_restful import Api
from resources.example_resource import ExampleResource

app = Flask(__name__)
api = Api(app)

api.add_resource(ExampleResource, '/example')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

### Frontend React Component

```jsx
// File: frontend/src/components/ExampleComponent.jsx

import React from 'react';

const ExampleComponent = () => {
  return <div className="example-component">This is an example component</div>;
};

export default ExampleComponent;
```

### RQ Worker Initialization

```python
# File: worker/start_worker.py

import os
from redis import Redis
from rq import Worker, Queue, Connection

listen = ['high', 'default', 'low']

redis_url = os.getenv('REDIS_URL', 'redis://localhost:6379')

conn = Redis.from_url(redis_url)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    with Connection(conn):
        worker = Worker(map(Queue, listen))
        worker.work()
```

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

**Issue**: Backend service not responding.

**Solution**: Ensure Gunicorn is correctly configured with multiple workers to handle concurrent requests. Check Gunicorn logs for any errors.

```shell
gunicorn -w 4 myapp:app
```

**Issue**: Database connection errors.

**Solution**: Verify PostgreSQL credentials and network settings. Ensure that Row Level Security policies do not unintentionally block access to required data.

**Issue**: Tasks not processing in Redis Queue.

**Solution**: Check if RQ workers are running and connected to the correct Redis instance. Inspect RQ dashboard or logs for any failed jobs or exceptions.
