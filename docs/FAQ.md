# Testing Sentry `trace_id` in MorningAI

## Overview

When developing and maintaining applications, monitoring and error tracking are crucial for identifying and solving issues efficiently. Sentry is a popular tool used for real-time error tracking, which helps developers monitor and fix crashes in real time. The `trace_id` is a unique identifier for each trace captured by Sentry, enabling developers to track specific issues or errors as they occur across the application's execution flow. This FAQ aims to guide MorningAI developers on how to test the `trace_id` functionality within the MorningAI platform, ensuring seamless integration with Sentry for error tracking and resolution.

## How to Test Sentry `trace_id`

To ensure that the Sentry `trace_id` is correctly implemented in your MorningAI application, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Configuration

Ensure that Sentry is properly configured in your MorningAI application. This involves setting up Sentry SDK with your DSN (Data Source Name) in the application's initialization code.

```python
import sentry_sdk
sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="your_sentry_dsn_here",
    traces_sample_rate=1.0
)
```

This code should be placed in a location that runs at the startup of your application, such as within the `app/__init__.py` file for Flask applications.

### Step 2: Generating a Trace with an Error

To test if `trace_id` is working, intentionally generate an error in your code where you can easily identify it. For instance:

```python
@app.route('/trigger_error')
def trigger_error():
    division_by_zero = 1 / 0  # This will cause a ZeroDivisionError
    return "This won't be executed due to the error above."
```

Accessing this route will generate an error that gets sent to Sentry.

### Step 3: Locating the `trace_id`

Once the error occurs, go to your Sentry dashboard. Locate the error event you generated; within its details, you'll find the `trace_id`. This ID can be used to correlate events and transactions across different services if your application spans multiple systems or microservices.

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

- **Issue:** The error does not appear in Sentry.
    - **Solution:** Ensure that your DSN is correctly configured and that there are no network issues blocking communication with Sentry's servers.
- **Issue:** The `trace_id` is not visible.
    - **Solution:** Make sure you're looking at an error or transaction event within Sentry. If viewing logs or metrics, `trace_id` might not be present.
- **Issue:** Transactions are missing or incomplete.
    - **Solution:** Review your sampling rate (`traces_sample_rate`). A low value could mean that not all transactions are being captured. Adjust this value according to your needs.
