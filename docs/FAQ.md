# System Architecture of MorningAI

MorningAI leverages a modern, scalable, and flexible architecture designed to efficiently handle multiple tasks such as autonomous code generation, FAQ generation, documentation management, and multi-platform integration. Below is a comprehensive overview of the system architecture, which will assist developers in understanding and utilizing the capabilities of MorningAI effectively.

## Overview

The core components of the MorningAI platform include:

- **Frontend**: Developed with React for a responsive user interface, utilizing Vite for an optimized build toolchain, and styled with TailwindCSS for a sleek design.
- **Backend**: Powered by Python with Flask serving as the web framework, Gunicorn as the WSGI HTTP Server with multi-worker support for enhanced performance.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL is used for data storage, integrated via Supabase which adds additional functionalities like Row Level Security (RLS) for data access control.
- **Queue System**: Redis Queue (RQ) is employed for task queuing to manage background jobs effectively, with worker heartbeat monitoring to ensure reliability.
- **Orchestration Layer**: LangGraph orchestrates agent workflows, enabling complex task management and execution sequences.
- **AI Engine**: Utilizes OpenAI's GPT-4 for high-quality content generation including code, FAQs, and documentation.
- **Deployment**: Hosted on Render.com with continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines in place to streamline updates and maintenance.

### Component Interaction

1. **Frontend to Backend Communication**: The frontend communicates with the backend via RESTful APIs or WebSocket connections for real-time interactions. This enables the dynamic exchange of data between users and the server.
   
2. **Backend Services & Data Management**: The Flask application handles all server-side logic including API requests processing, interaction with the PostgreSQL database through Supabase for CRUD operations, and executing autonomous agent tasks.

3. **Task Orchestration & Execution**: Tasks such as code generation are queued in Redis Queue (RQ), where they are managed asynchronously to prevent blocking the main application flow. LangGraph orchestrates these tasks based on dependencies and execution order.

4. **Content Generation & Management**: Utilizing GPT-4, MorningAI generates content dynamically. This content can range from code snippets to comprehensive FAQs and documentation.

5. **Deployment & Scaling**: Render.com facilitates easy deployment and scaling of the MorningAI platform. It automatically handles load balancing across multiple instances to ensure optimal performance even under heavy loads.

### Code Examples

#### Flask Application Initialization

```python
from flask import Flask
from flask_cors import CORS

app = Flask(__name__)
CORS(app)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
```

#### Redis Queue Task Example

```python
from rq import Queue
from redis import Redis
import time

redis_conn = Redis()
q = Queue(connection=redis_conn)

def background_task(n):
    """Function that returns len(n) and simulates a delay."""
    time.sleep(1)
    return len(n)

job = q.enqueue(background_task, 'http://example.com')
```

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

### Backend Not Responding

1. Ensure Gunicorn is running with the correct number of workers.
2. Check if there's a database connectivity issue.
3. Verify that Redis Queue workers are up and processing jobs.

### Frontend Build Issues

1. Confirm all Node.js dependencies are installed (`npm install`).
2. Check Vite configuration for any misconfigurations.
3. Ensure environment variables are correctly set up for both development and production environments.
