# Test Retry Success in MorningAI

Understanding how to manage and ensure the success of test retries in the MorningAI platform is crucial for maintaining a high-quality, reliable codebase. This FAQ section provides a comprehensive guide on leveraging test retries within the MorningAI environment, ensuring that temporary issues do not hinder your development workflow.

## Understanding Test Retries

Test retries in MorningAI are designed to handle scenarios where tests might fail due to transient issues, such as network latency, dependencies on external services, or other flaky test conditions. By retrying a failed test, we can ascertain whether the failure was sporadic or indicative of a genuine bug in the code.

### Configuration

MorningAI utilizes pytest along with its retry mechanism to implement test retries. To configure test retries, you need to modify the `pytest.ini` file or pass parameters directly via the command line when initiating tests.

#### `pytest.ini` Configuration Example:

```ini
[pytest]
addopts = --reruns 3 --reruns-delay 5
```

This configuration instructs pytest to retry failed tests up to three times with a delay of five seconds between each attempt.

#### Command Line Configuration Example:

```bash
pytest --reruns 3 --reruns-delay 5
```

### Code Example: Using pytest-rerunfailures

If you're not already using `pytest-rerunfailures`, you'll need to install it as part of your development environment. This plugin adds support for re-running failed tests in pytest.

```bash
pip install pytest-rerunfailures
```

Once installed, you can use it by adding the `--reruns` and `--reruns-delay` flags either in your `pytest.ini` file or directly in your command line invocation of pytest, as shown above.

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

### Tests Still Fail After Retries

If tests continue to fail even after retries, consider the following:
- **Review Test Stability**: Ensure the test is stable and not inherently flaky.
- **External Dependencies**: Verify that any external service or dependency is reliable during the test execution window.
- **Increase Delay**: Sometimes increasing the delay between retries (`--reruns-delay`) can help, especially if the issue is related to temporal external service availability.

### Plugin Installation Issues

If you encounter problems installing `pytest-rerunfailures` or other related plugins:
- Ensure your Python environment is correctly set up and activated.
- Check for compatibility issues between your version of pytest and the plugin version.
- Try clearing your pip cache (`pip cache purge`) and retrying the installation.
