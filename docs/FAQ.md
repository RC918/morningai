# System Architecture of MorningAI

MorningAI leverages a robust, scalable architecture designed to facilitate autonomous code generation, documentation management, and multi-platform integration. Below is an in-depth explanation of the core components and how they interact within the system.

## Core Components:

### 1. **Frontend**:
The frontend is built with **React**, utilizing **Vite** for an optimized build process and **TailwindCSS** for styling. This setup ensures a fast, responsive user interface that adapts to various device screens, providing an excellent user experience.

- **Repository Path**: `RC918/morningai/frontend`
- **Related Documentation**: React (https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html), Vite (https://vitejs.dev/guide/), TailwindCSS (https://tailwindcss.com/docs)

### 2. **Backend**:
Our backend leverages **Python** with the **Flask** framework, running on **Gunicorn** as the WSGI HTTP Server with multi-worker support for handling concurrent requests efficiently.

- **Repository Path**: `RC918/morningai/backend`
- **Related Documentation**: Flask (https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.1.x/), Gunicorn (https://gunicorn.org/#docs)

### 3. **Database**:
We use **PostgreSQL**, hosted on **Supabase**, which provides us with advanced features like Row Level Security for enhanced data protection. Supabase extends PostgreSQL with a RESTful API, allowing for easy integration with our backend.

- **Repository Path**: `RC918/morningai/database`
- **Related Documentation**: PostgreSQL (https://www.postgresql.org/docs/), Supabase (https://supabase.io/docs)

### 4. **Queue System**:
For real-time task orchestration, we utilize **Redis Queue (RQ)**. It's configured with worker heartbeat monitoring to ensure tasks are executed reliably without loss or duplication.

- **Repository Path**: `RC918/morningai/queue`
- **Related Documentation**: Redis Queue (http://python-rq.org/docs/)

### 5. **Orchestration**:
Task flows and autonomous agent interactions are managed through **LangGraph**, ensuring efficient execution of complex workflows across multiple components.

- **Repository Path**: Not specified but integrated within backend logic.
- **Related Documentation**: LangGraph documentation might be proprietary or based on internal conventions.

### 6. **AI Integration**:
Content generation and other AI-driven tasks are powered by OpenAI's GPT-4, offering state-of-the-art natural language processing capabilities.

- **Repository Path**: Integrated within various parts of both frontend and backend for dynamic content generation.
- **Related Documentation**: OpenAI API (https://beta.openai.com/docs/)

### 7. **Deployment & CI/CD**:
The platform is deployed on Render.com, benefiting from its seamless CI/CD pipelines that ensure quick and reliable deployments from our repository to production environments.

- **Repository Path**: Configuration files related to deployment can be found under `.render` directory.
- **Related Documentation**: Render (https://render.com/docs)

## Common Troubleshooting Tips:

1. ### Frontend Issues:
   - Ensure all node modules are installed: `npm install`.
   - Verify environment variables are correctly set for both development and production environments.
   
2. ### Backend & Database Connectivity:
   - Test database connections using Supabase CLI or direct connection strings.
   - Check Gunicorn worker logs for any backend service interruptions or errors.

3. ### Queue System Monitoring:
   - Use RQ Dashboard to monitor job statuses and worker health.
   - Ensure Redis server is up and accessible by all workers.

4. ### Deployment Errors:
   - Review Render.com deployment logs for any build or deployment failures.
   - Confirm that all environment variables required by the application are properly configured in Render's dashboard.

By understanding each component of MorningAI's system architecture, developers can effectively navigate the codebase, contribute to the project, and troubleshoot potential issues that arise during development or deployment processes.
