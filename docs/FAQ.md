# Test Retry Success in MorningAI

Understanding and implementing test retries can be crucial for improving the stability and reliability of automated tests within the MorningAI platform. This FAQ aims to provide a comprehensive overview of how to configure and utilize test retry mechanisms effectively.

## Explanation of Test Retries

Test retries are a mechanism that allows failing tests to be automatically rerun a specified number of times before being marked as failed. This feature is particularly useful in continuous integration (CI) environments where tests might fail sporadically due to temporary issues such as network latency or resource contention. By enabling retries, you can reduce the likelihood of false negatives affecting your build process.

MorningAI utilizes a robust testing framework that supports test retries, ensuring that transient failures do not hinder development velocity.

## Configuring Test Retries

To configure test retries within the MorningAI platform, you'll need to modify your test configuration file. Here's an example using Python's `unittest` framework adjusted for use with Flask and Gunicorn, which are part of MorningAI's backend stack:

```python
import unittest
from flask_testing import LiveServerTestCase
from myapp import create_app, db

class MyTest(LiveServerTestCase):

    def create_app(self):
        app = create_app('testing')
        app.config['LIVESERVER_PORT'] = 8943
        return app

    @classmethod
    def setUpClass(cls):
        # Setup code here

    @classmethod
    def tearDownClass(cls):
        # Teardown code here

    def test_something(self):
        # Your test code here
        self.assertTrue(True)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    from retrying import retry

    def retry_if_error(exception):
        return isinstance(exception, AssertionError)

    @retry(retry_on_exception=retry_if_error, stop_max_attempt_number=3)
    def run_test():
        suite = unittest.defaultTestLoader.loadTestsFromTestCase(MyTest)
        unittest.TextTestRunner().run(suite)

    run_test()
```

This example demonstrates how to wrap your test runner in a retry mechanism using the `retrying` library. The `retry_if_error` function specifies that retries should occur in case of an `AssertionError`, which typically indicates a test failure. The `stop_max_attempt_number=3` parameter means the test will be retried up to two additional times after the initial failure.

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

1. **Ensure Consistent Environment**: Make sure that your testing environment is as consistent as possible between runs to avoid introducing variability that could affect the outcome of retried tests.
2. **Isolate Tests**: Ensure that tests are isolated and do not depend on the side effects of other tests. Dependencies between tests can lead to flakiness and unpredictable results.
3. **Review Logs Carefully**: When a test fails but succeeds upon retry, it's essential to review the logs carefully to understand why it failed initially. This can help identify and fix underlying issues that could cause future failures.
4. **Adjust Retry Settings**: If you notice that tests frequently need multiple retries before passing, consider adjusting your retry settings or investigating potential stability issues in your application or testing environment.

Remember, while test retries can help mitigate the impact of flaky tests, they should not be used as a substitute for addressing underlying issues that cause test instability.
