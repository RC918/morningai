# Testing Sentry `trace_id` in MorningAI

When integrating Sentry with MorningAI for application monitoring and error tracking, it's crucial to understand and test the `trace_id` mechanism. The `trace_id` is a unique identifier for a set of operations that are part of a single trace, allowing developers to follow the path of a request through various services and components of the application. This FAQ aims to guide developers on how to test and utilize the `trace_id` within the MorningAI platform.

## Understanding `trace_id`

In the context of Sentry with MorningAI, a `trace_id` is generated whenever a transaction or event occurs within the system. This ID can be used to correlate logs, errors, and performance data, providing a cohesive view of what happened during a request's lifecycle.

### Generating and Using `trace_id`

To generate and use a `trace_id` in MorningAI, ensure that your Sentry SDK is correctly initialized in your application setup. Here is an example of initializing Sentry in a Flask application (which is part of MorningAI's backend technology stack):

```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.flask import FlaskIntegration

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="your_sentry_dsn_here",
    integrations=[FlaskIntegration()],
    traces_sample_rate=1.0 # Adjust sampling rate as needed
)
```

After initialization, Sentry automatically assigns a `trace_id` to every transaction. You can access this `trace_id` programmatically in your code as follows:

```python
from flask import request
from sentry_sdk import Hub

@app.route('/your_route')
def your_function():
    trace_id = Hub.current.scope.span.trace_id
    print(f"Current trace ID: {trace_id}")
    # Your code logic here
```

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

1. **Trace ID not appearing**: Ensure that the Sentry SDK is correctly initialized with your DSN and that you have enabled performance monitoring by setting a sample rate.
2. **Incorrect sampling rate**: Adjusting the `traces_sample_rate` in your Sentry initialization can help manage the volume of data reported and ensure important transactions do not get missed.
3. **Delays in seeing traces**: Sometimes there may be delays in data appearing in Sentry due to network latency or configuration issues. Verify your network settings and check Sentry's status page for any ongoing incidents.

By following these guidelines, developers working with MorningAI should be able to effectively implement, test, and troubleshoot the use of Sentry's `trace_id` functionality within their applications.
