# How to Use MorningAI for Autonomous Code Generation

MorningAI leverages an advanced autonomous agent system powered by AI to streamline the process of code generation. This feature is designed to enhance productivity and accelerate development cycles by automatically generating code snippets, modules, or even entire applications based on user input. This FAQ aims to guide developers on how to utilize MorningAI's autonomous code generation capabilities effectively.

## Comprehensive Explanation

MorningAI's autonomous code generation is built upon OpenAI's GPT-4, ensuring that the generated code is not only syntactically correct but also optimized for performance. The platform integrates this feature seamlessly into its multi-tenant SaaS framework, allowing developers to invoke autonomous agents directly from their workspace.

### Key Features:
- **Autonomous Agent System**: Utilizes AI models to interpret user requests and generate corresponding code.
- **Multi-platform Integration**: Supports generating code for various platforms including web, mobile, and desktop applications.
- **Real-time Task Orchestration**: Ensures efficient management and execution of code generation tasks through Redis Queue.
- **Vector Memory Storage**: Leverages pgvector/Supabase for storing and retrieving complex data structures required during the code generation process.

### Getting Started

To begin using the autonomous code generation feature in MorningAI, ensure that your development environment is set up correctly. This includes having access to the RC918/morningai repository and configuring your workspace with necessary dependencies.

#### Initial Setup:
1. Clone the `RC918/morningai` repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RC918/morningai.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the cloned directory and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd morningai
   npm install
   ```

#### Using Autonomous Code Generation:
1. Access the autonomous agent system through your project dashboard.
2. Specify your requirements for the code you wish to generate. This can range from simple functions to complex modules.
3. Submit your request. The backend, leveraging Python and Flask, processes your input and interacts with the AI model.
4. The generated code will be returned in real-time, ready for review and integration into your project.

### Example:

Requesting an autonomous agent to generate a simple REST API endpoint in Python:

```python
# User inputs their request in a structured format or natural language
request = "Generate a Flask REST API endpoint for retrieving users"

# The autonomous agent processes the request and generates code
generated_code = MorningAI.generate_code(request)

print(generated_code)
```

This would output a Flask endpoint similar to:

```python
from flask import Flask, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/users', methods=['GET'])
def get_users():
    # Dummy data - replace with actual database call
    users = [{"name": "John Doe"}, {"name": "Jane Doe"}]
    return jsonify(users)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

### Common Troubleshooting Tips:
- **Issue:** Autonomous agent returns incomplete or incorrect code.
  - **Solution:** Ensure that your input request is clear and detailed. Provide context where necessary.
  
- **Issue:** Code generation task hangs or fails unexpectedly.
  - **Solution:** Check the Redis Queue (RQ) status for any pending tasks or errors. Ensure that Redis server is running properly.
