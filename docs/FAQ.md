# System Architecture of MorningAI

MorningAI leverages a robust and scalable system architecture designed to facilitate seamless integration and efficient operation across various platforms. This architecture supports autonomous agent systems for code generation, FAQ generation, documentation management, multi-platform integration, real-time task orchestration, and vector memory storage. Below is a comprehensive overview of the MorningAI system architecture, including its key components and how they interact within the ecosystem.

## Overview

The system architecture of MorningAI is built on a microservices model, utilizing a range of technologies to ensure high performance, scalability, and reliability. Here's a breakdown of the main components:

### Frontend
- **Technology Stack**: React with Vite for bundling and TailwindCSS for styling.
- **Functionality**: Provides the user interface for interacting with MorningAI services.

### Backend
- **Technology Stack**: Python with Flask as the web framework and Gunicorn as the WSGI HTTP server with multi-worker support.
- **Functionality**: Handles API requests, business logic, and interaction with other backend services.

### Database
- **Technology Stack**: PostgreSQL hosted on Supabase, utilizing Row Level Security (RLS) for enhanced data protection.
- **Functionality**: Stores user data, agent configurations, documentation content, and other persistent data.

### Queue
- **Technology Stack**: Redis Queue (RQ) with worker heartbeat monitoring to manage background jobs efficiently.
- **Functionality**: Manages task queues for asynchronous processing tasks like code generation or document parsing.

### Orchestration
- **Technology Stack**: LangGraph for managing agent workflows in an efficient and scalable manner.
- **Functionality**: Coordinates complex processes across multiple services and agents.

### AI
- **Technology Stack**: OpenAI GPT-4 for advanced content generation capabilities.
- **Functionality**: Powers intelligent agents for code generation and FAQ/document content creation.

### Deployment
- **Platform**: Render.com with continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.
- **Functionality**: Automates the deployment process, ensuring that updates are smoothly rolled out without downtime.

## Code Example

While specific code examples related to each component might vary widely based on the task at hand, below is a simplified example showcasing how to initiate a background job using Redis Queue in Flask:

```python
from redis import Redis
from rq import Queue
from your_task_module import execute_long_task

# Initialize Redis connection and queue
redis_conn = Redis()
q = Queue(connection=redis_conn)

# Enqueue a long-running task
job = q.enqueue(execute_long_task, 'parameter1', 'parameter2')
```

This example demonstrates adding a long-running task `execute_long_task` to the queue with parameters `'parameter1'` and `'parameter2'`.

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

1. **Database Connectivity Issues**: Ensure that your Supabase credentials are correctly configured in your environment variables. Verify that your IP is whitelisted if RLS is enabled.
2. **Failed Background Jobs in RQ**: Check the Redis server status and ensure it's running. Review job failure logs for specific errors.
3. **Deployment Failures on Render.com**: Ensure that your `render.yaml` file is correctly configured according to your project needs. Check the Render dashboard for specific error messages during deployment.
