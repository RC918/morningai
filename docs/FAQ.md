# Test Retry Mechanism in MorningAI

Understanding and implementing a test retry mechanism is crucial for maintaining the reliability of the MorningAI platform. This mechanism ensures that transient errors or flakiness in tests do not lead to unnecessary failures, improving the robustness of our continuous integration (CI) pipeline.

## Explanation

MorningAI utilizes a test retry mechanism to automatically rerun failed tests before marking them as true failures. This approach helps to distinguish between genuine issues in the codebase and temporary glitches, such as network timeouts or database lock contention. Implementing retries can significantly reduce the manual effort required to investigate and rerun failed tests, thereby speeding up the development cycle.

### Configuration

The test retry mechanism can be configured in our CI configuration file or directly within our test framework. For Python projects using pytest, we recommend using the `pytest-rerunfailures` plugin. This plugin allows specifying the number of times to rerun failed tests, ensuring minimal disruption to our workflow.

```python
# Install pytest-rerunfailures
pip install pytest-rerunfailures

# Example usage with pytest command
pytest --reruns 3
```

This command will rerun each failed test up to three times. If a test passes on any rerun, it will be marked as passed in the final report.

### Integration with MorningAI

To integrate this mechanism into MorningAI's CI pipeline, locate the CI configuration file (e.g., `.gitlab-ci.yml`, `.circleci/config.yml`, or `.github/workflows/ci.yml`) and modify the test command to include the retry option:

```yaml
# Example for a GitHub Actions workflow
test:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v2
  - name: Run tests with retry
    run: |
      pip install -r requirements.txt
      pytest --reruns 3
```

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

- **Dependencies Not Installed**: Ensure all dependencies are correctly installed in your CI environment, including `pytest` and `pytest-rerunfailures`.
- **Incorrect Command Usage**: Verify that the `--reruns` flag is used correctly with pytest. Incorrect usage may not trigger retries as expected.
- **Flaky Tests Detection**: While retries can help mitigate flaky tests, they may also mask underlying issues. Always investigate recurring flakiness to identify potential stability improvements in your codebase.
