# System Architecture of MorningAI

MorningAI is a comprehensive multi-tenant SaaS platform designed to offer a wide array of features including autonomous agent systems for code generation, FAQ generation, documentation management, multi-platform integration, real-time task orchestration, and vector memory storage capabilities. This section aims to provide developers with an in-depth understanding of the system architecture, facilitating better utilization and customization.

## Overview

The architecture of MorningAI is built to be robust, scalable, and efficient, leveraging modern technologies across its stack. Here's a breakdown of its core components:

### Frontend

- **Technology**: React.js with Vite and TailwindCSS for rapid development and stylish design.
- **Path**: The frontend codebase can be found under `/frontend` in the repository.
- **Functionality**: Provides the user interface for interaction with MorningAI's features.

#### Example:
```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import './index.css';
import App from './App';

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

### Backend

- **Technology**: Python with Flask and Gunicorn serving as the application server with multi-worker support.
- **Path**: Backend source code resides in `/backend`.
- **Functionality**: Handles API requests, integrates with databases and third-party services.

#### Example:
```python
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello, World!'
```

### Database

- **Technology**: PostgreSQL hosted on Supabase with Row Level Security (RLS) for data integrity and security.
- **Path**: Database schemas and migrations are managed within `/database`.
- **Functionality**: Stores user data, session information, generated content, etc.

### Queue

- **Technology**: Redis Queue (RQ) for managing background tasks with worker heartbeat monitoring.
- **Path**: Configuration and queue management scripts are located in `/queue`.
- **Functionality**: Enables asynchronous task processing for improved performance.

### Orchestration

- **Technology**: LangGraph for managing agent workflows efficiently.
- **Functionality**: Coordinates complex operations between different components of the system.

### AI

- **Technology**: Utilizes OpenAI's GPT-4 for state-of-the-art content generation.
- **Integration Point**: Integrated within backend services for dynamic content creation tasks.

### Deployment

- **Service**: Render.com is used for hosting with continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.
- **Configuration Path**: Deployment configurations are specified in `render.yaml` at the root of the repository.

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

1. **Frontend Issues**:
   - Ensure all dependencies are up to date with `npm install` or `yarn install`.
   - Check browser console for errors that may indicate issues with React components or API calls.

2. **Backend & API Connectivity**:
   - Verify Flask application is running and accessible.
   - Use Postman or similar tools to test API endpoints directly.

3. **Database Access**:
   - Ensure correct RLS policies are applied if facing access restrictions.
   - Check Supabase dashboard logs for any errors during query execution.

4. **Queue Worker Failures**:
   - Monitor worker health via Redis Queue Dashboard.
   - Review logs for specific job failures which often include exception details.

5. **Deployment Errors**:
   - Refer to Render.com documentation for common CI/CD pipeline issues.
   - Check build logs in Render dashboard to identify any deployment errors.
