# Test Retry Success in MorningAI

In the context of developing with MorningAI, ensuring the reliability and stability of your integrations and code is paramount. One of the mechanisms to achieve this is by implementing test retries to handle transient failures that can occur due to various reasons such as network issues, dependencies unavailability, or temporary service downtimes. This FAQ aims to guide developers on how to effectively implement and utilize test retries within the MorningAI platform.

## Understanding Test Retries

Test retries are designed to automatically rerun failed tests before marking them as failures. This approach helps in distinguishing between flaky tests and genuinely broken functionality. Implementing retries can significantly improve your CI/CD pipeline's efficiency by reducing the need for manual intervention when encountering intermittent failures.

### Implementation in MorningAI

MorningAI leverages a combination of technologies including Python, Flask, and Redis Queue (RQ) for task orchestration. To implement test retries, particularly in asynchronous tasks or during integration testing, you can utilize the RQ's retry mechanism or pytest's retrying capabilities for synchronous test cases.

#### Using Redis Queue (RQ) for Asynchronous Tasks

For tasks that are enqueued with Redis Queue, you can specify retry parameters directly when you enqueue a job. Here's an example:

```python
from redis import Redis
from rq import Queue
from my_module import my_task

redis_conn = Redis()
q = Queue(connection=redis_conn)

# Enqueue the task with retry support
job = q.enqueue(my_task, failure_ttl=3600, retry={'max': 3, 'interval': [10, 30, 60]})
```

In this example, `failure_ttl` specifies how long (in seconds) the failed job is kept, while `retry` defines the retry strategy. Here it will retry up to 3 times with an interval that increases after each attempt.

#### Using Pytest for Synchronous Testing

When dealing with synchronous tests, using pytest along with a plugin like `pytest-rerunfailures` can be effective:

Firstly, install the plugin if you haven't:

```shell
pip install pytest-rerunfailures
```

Then, you can specify the number of retries directly in your pytest command:

```shell
pytest --reruns 3 --reruns-delay 5
```

This command tells pytest to rerun failed tests up to 3 times with a delay of 5 seconds between each retry.

### Common Troubleshooting Tips

- **Ensure Dependencies Are Available**: Before relying on retries, make sure that all external dependencies are stable and available during testing.
- **Monitor Retry Patterns**: Consistent failures even after retries might indicate a deeper issue with your code or its dependencies.
- **Avoid Overuse**: While useful, over-relying on test retries can mask problems that should be fixed directly in the codebase or its environment.

Implementing test retries correctly can save time and resources while maintaining the robustness of your CI/CD pipeline. By following these guidelines within MorningAI's ecosystem, developers can ensure their applications remain resilient against transient issues.
