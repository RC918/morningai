# MorningAI System Architecture

MorningAI leverages a modern, scalable, and efficient system architecture designed to provide a robust platform for autonomous code generation, FAQ generation, documentation management, and multi-platform integration. This architecture is built to handle real-time task orchestration and vector memory storage efficiently. Below is a detailed breakdown of MorningAI's system architecture components and how they interact within the ecosystem.

## Components

### Frontend

- **Technology Stack**: The frontend is built using React, leveraging Vite for an optimized build toolchain and TailwindCSS for styling.
- **Functionality**: It provides the user interface for interacting with the MorningAI platform, including code generation requests, managing documentation, and configuring integrations.

### Backend

- **Technology Stack**: Python powers the backend with Flask serving as the web framework. Gunicorn is used as the WSGI HTTP server with multi-worker support to handle concurrent requests efficiently.
- **Functionality**: Handles API requests, autonomous agent system logic, task orchestration, and interacts with the database and queue systems.

### Database

- **Technology Stack**: PostgreSQL with Row Level Security (RLS) features, hosted on Supabase. This setup offers robust data storage with enhanced security measures.
- **Functionality**: Stores user data, generated codes, FAQs content, and other necessary information. pgvector is used within PostgreSQL for vector memory storage capabilities.

### Queue System

- **Technology Stack**: Redis Queue (RQ) is used for managing background tasks with worker heartbeat monitoring to ensure reliability.
- **Functionality**: Facilitates asynchronous execution of heavy or time-consuming tasks such as code generation or batch processing without blocking the main application flow.

### Orchestration

- **Technology Stack**: LangGraph is employed for agent workflows to manage complex task dependencies and execution sequences.
- **Functionality**: Coordinates between different services and agents in the system to ensure smooth operation and efficient resource management.

### AI

- **Technology Stack**: OpenAI's GPT-4 model is integrated for content generation tasks including FAQ content creation and code suggestions.
- **Functionality**: Provides intelligent content generation capabilities making use of advanced natural language processing techniques.

### Deployment

- **Platform**: The entire stack is deployed on Render.com with Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines set up for automated testing and deployment.
- **Functionality**: Ensures that new changes are automatically tested and deployed to production in a streamlined manner without manual intervention.

## Example Code Snippet
Below is an example snippet showing how a task might be enqueued in Redis Queue:

```python
from redis import Redis
from rq import Queue
from my_module import some_long_running_task

redis_conn = Redis()
q = Queue(connection=redis_conn)

result = q.enqueue(some_long_running_task, 'my argument')
```

## Common Troubleshooting Tips
1. **Failed Task Execution in RQ**:
   - Check Redis server status.
   - Ensure worker processes are running.
   - Review task exception messages in worker logs.

2. **Database Connection Issues**:
   - Verify database credentials in your application configuration.
   - Check network ACLs/firewall rules if connecting from an external network.

3. **Deployment Failures on Render**:
   - Review build logs for specific error messages.
   - Ensure all environment variables are correctly set up in Render dashboard.
   - Validate your `render.yaml` configuration file for syntax errors or missing fields.
