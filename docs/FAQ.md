# System Architecture of MorningAI

MorningAI leverages a modern, scalable system architecture designed to handle multiple tasks simultaneously, ranging from autonomous code generation to FAQ generation and documentation management, with seamless multi-platform integration. This architecture is built on a robust technology stack that ensures high performance, reliability, and scalability.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Implemented with React for building the user interface, Vite as the build tool for fast development and production builds, and TailwindCSS for styling.
- **Backend**: Python with Flask framework is used for server-side logic, Gunicorn as the WSGI HTTP Server for running Python web applications with multi-worker support for handling multiple requests at the same time.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Supabase) is utilized for data storage with Row Level Security (RLS) features enabled to ensure data integrity and security.
- **Queue**: Redis Queue (RQ) handles task queuing to manage background jobs and worker processes efficiently.
- **Orchestration**: LangGraph orchestrates agent workflows to ensure tasks are performed in an efficient and orderly manner.
- **AI**: OpenAI GPT-4 powers content generation, providing advanced natural language processing capabilities.
- **Deployment**: Render.com is used for hosting the application with Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) to automate deployment processes.

## Architecture Overview

The system architecture of MorningAI can be divided into several key components:

1. **Frontend**: The frontend serves as the interface through which users interact with MorningAI. It sends requests to the backend via RESTful APIs or GraphQL endpoints.

2. **Backend Server**: The backend server processes incoming requests from the frontend, interacts with the database or external services as needed, and returns responses back to the frontend.

3. **Database**: Stores all persistent data related to user information, documentation content, task statuses, etc. Supabase enhances PostgreSQL with additional features like instant APIs without writing any backend code.

4. **Queue System**: For asynchronous task processing, RQ is used to queue tasks that are processed by background workers. This is crucial for tasks that are too time-consuming to be run during a standard HTTP request/response cycle.

5. **AI and Orchestration Layer**: AI-driven content generation and task orchestration are handled at this layer using GPT-4 and LangGraph respectively. This allows MorningAI to autonomously generate code snippets, FAQs, and manage documentation efficiently.

6. **Deployment & CI/CD Pipeline**: Render.com facilitates smooth deployment of MorningAI updates through its CI/CD pipeline. This ensures that new features, bug fixes, or performance improvements can be deployed rapidly.

### Code Example: Flask Application Setup

```python
from flask import Flask
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
from redis import Redis
import rq

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'postgresql://supabase_url_here'
db = SQLAlchemy(app)

# Setup Redis Queue
app.redis = Redis(host='localhost', port=6379)
app.task_queue = rq.Queue('morningai-tasks', connection=app.redis)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
```

This snippet demonstrates initializing a Flask application with SQLAlchemy for database interactions and setting up Redis Queue for task management.

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

1. **Issue:** Backend server not starting.
   - **Solution:** Check if Gunicorn is correctly configured with Flask app instance in your `gunicorn.conf.py` or command line arguments.
   
2. **Issue:** Tasks not being processed by RQ workers.
   - **Solution:** Ensure Redis server is running and accessible by your application. Verify that workers are running using `rq worker` command.
   
3. **Issue:** Database connectivity issues.
   - **Solution:** Confirm that PostgreSQL credentials in Supabase are correctly configured in your application's environment variables or configuration files.

By understanding the system architecture of MorningAI and following these guidelines, developers can effectively work within this ecosystem to develop, deploy, and maintain robust applications on this platform.
