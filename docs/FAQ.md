# Testing Sentry `trace_id` Integration in MorningAI

In this section, we'll cover how to test and ensure that Sentry's `trace_id` integration functions correctly within the MorningAI platform. This is crucial for monitoring, error tracking, and ensuring a smooth operational flow across the system's microservices.

## Understanding `trace_id` in Sentry

Sentry utilizes `trace_id` to track and aggregate errors and performance issues across distributed systems. This identifier helps developers link errors to specific transactions or traces, providing a clearer context for debugging and resolution.

## Integration in MorningAI

MorningAI integrates Sentry for real-time error tracking and performance monitoring. Each autonomous agent, task, or process within the platform is assigned a unique `trace_id`, allowing developers to monitor activities and troubleshoot issues effectively.

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have access to the RC918/morningai repository.
- Sentry account with access to the MorningAI project.
- Relevant environment variables must be configured (`SENTRY_DSN`, etc.).

### Code Example: Generating and Using `trace_id`

When an autonomous agent initiates a task, MorningAI generates a `trace_id`. Here's how it's integrated:

```python
import sentry_sdk

sentry_sdk.init(dsn="your_sentry_dsn")

def generate_trace_id():
    from sentry_sdk import Hub
    trace_id = Hub.current.trace_id
    return trace_id

def task_handler():
    trace_id = generate_trace_id()
    # Log or pass this trace_id as needed
    print(f"Handling task with trace ID: {trace_id}")
```

Replace `"your_sentry_dsn"` with your actual Sentry DSN. This code snippet demonstrates initializing Sentry SDK, generating a `trace_id`, and using it within a task handler function.

### Troubleshooting Tips

**Issue**: Missing `trace_id` in Sentry transactions.

**Solution**: Ensure that Sentry is correctly initialized at the start of your application. Verify that the DSN is correctly set in your environment variables.

**Issue**: Errors not linking with `trace_id`.

**Solution**: Check if the `trace_id` is correctly passed and logged within your tasks or error handlers. Confirm that the Sentry SDK version supports automatic tracing.
