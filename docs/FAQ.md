# Handling MorningAI During a Redis Outage

Redis, as an in-memory data structure store, plays a crucial role in MorningAI's real-time task orchestration. It is used with Redis Queue (RQ) to manage background jobs, which are essential for the platform's operation. However, outages can occur due to various reasons such as network issues, configuration errors, or resource limitations. Understanding how to handle and mitigate the impact of a Redis outage is vital for maintaining the stability and reliability of the MorningAI platform.

## Understanding the Impact

When Redis becomes unavailable, several features of MorningAI will be directly affected:
- **Task Orchestration**: Real-time task processing will halt, causing delays in autonomous agent system operations and multi-platform integrations.
- **Job Queuing**: New tasks cannot be queued, and existing tasks in the queue will not be processed until Redis service is restored.
- **Vector Memory Storage Operations**: Any operation relying on pgvector/Supabase for vector memory storage that requires real-time data processing might experience delays or failures.

## Immediate Actions

1. **Verify Redis Service Status**: First, check if the Redis service is running. Use the command line or your hosting provider's dashboard to confirm the service status.

    ```bash
    redis-cli ping
    ```

    If Redis is running correctly, you should receive a `PONG` response.

2. **Check Logs for Errors**: Review the Redis logs for any error messages that can indicate what caused the outage. The log file location depends on your installation, but commonly it can be found at `/var/log/redis/redis-server.log`.

3. **Resource Utilization**: Ensure there's enough memory and CPU resources available for Redis. High utilization can lead to performance issues or crashes.

4. **Network Issues**: Verify network connectivity between your application servers and the Redis server.

## Recovery Steps

Once you've identified and addressed the cause of the outage (e.g., restarted the service if it was down, upgraded resources if they were insufficient), follow these steps to recover:

1. **Restart MorningAI Services**: After ensuring that Redis is back online, restart MorningAI services that depend on Redis Queue (RQ) to flush any stale connections and reinitialize task processing.
   
   Example with Gunicorn:
   ```bash
   systemctl restart gunicorn_morningai
   ```

2. **Monitor Failed Jobs**: Check RQ's failed job registry to identify any tasks that need to be retried or manually handled.
   
   Python script example to retry failed jobs:
   ```python
   from redis import Redis
   from rq import Connection, Queue

   with Connection(Redis()):
       failed_queue = Queue('failed')
       for job in failed_queue.jobs:
           job.retry()
   ```

3. **Validate System Integrity**: Run integrity checks on your application data to ensure no corruption occurred during the outage.

## Preventing Future Outages

- Implement high availability (HA) for Redis using replication and automatic failover.
- Regularly monitor resource usage and scale as necessary.
- Keep your Redis version up-to-date with security patches and performance improvements.

## Troubleshooting Tips

- If you're unable to connect to Redis even though it appears to be running, check firewall rules and security group settings.
- For persistent outages without clear causes in logs or metrics, consider reaching out to your hosting provider or consulting with a Redis expert.

For more detailed guidance on managing background tasks with RQ and handling outages effectively, refer to the [RQ documentation](http://python-rq.org/docs/) and [Redis documentation](https://redis.io/documentation).
