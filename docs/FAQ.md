# System Architecture of MorningAI

MorningAI leverages a modern, scalable, and robust architecture designed to provide efficient autonomous agent system functionalities for code generation, FAQ generation, documentation management, and multi-platform integration. Below is a detailed explanation of the system architecture, including its components and how they interact within the MorningAI ecosystem.

## Overview

The MorningAI platform is structured around a microservices architecture, utilizing various technologies to ensure high performance, scalability, and reliability. The primary components of the system include:

- **Frontend:** Developed with React, utilizing Vite as the build tool and TailwindCSS for styling.
- **Backend:** The server-side logic is handled by Python with Flask serving as the web framework. Gunicorn is used as the WSGI HTTP Server with multi-worker support for handling concurrent requests efficiently.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL is used for data storage, with Supabase adding additional functionalities such as row-level security to enhance data access controls.
- **Queue System:** Redis Queue (RQ) is employed for managing background tasks and real-time task orchestration.
- **Orchestration:** LangGraph is utilized for managing agent workflows within the platform.
- **AI Integration:** OpenAI's GPT-4 model is integrated for content generation tasks including FAQ generation and code suggestions.
- **Deployment:** The entire infrastructure is deployed on Render.com, leveraging its capabilities for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD).

## Detailed Architecture

### Frontend

```plaintext
src/
├── components/     # Reusable UI components
├── pages/          # Application pages
├── styles/         # TailwindCSS configuration
└── main.jsx        # Entry point
```

The frontend application communicates with the backend via RESTful APIs or WebSocket connections for real-time interactions. It's built for responsiveness across devices and optimized for performance.

### Backend

```python
from flask import Flask
from werkzeug.middleware.proxy_fix import ProxyFix

app = Flask(__name__)
app.wsgi_app = ProxyFix(app.wsgi_app)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()
```

The backend handles API requests, interacts with the database through Supabase services, manages task queues with Redis Queue, and orchestrates AI-driven operations.

### Database Configuration

```sql
-- Enable Row Level Security for a table
ALTER TABLE your_table ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

Supabase enhances PostgreSQL with additional features like authentication services, real-time subscriptions, and row-level security to fine-tune access controls.

### Task Orchestration

Tasks are managed using Redis Queue (RQ), which allows efficient processing of background tasks. The worker heartbeat monitoring ensures reliability in task execution.

### AI Integration

The integration with OpenAI's GPT-4 enables MorningAI to generate accurate and contextually relevant content. This component interacts closely with the backend to provide dynamic content generation capabilities.

### Deployment

Deployed on Render.com, the platform benefits from easy scaling options and automated deployments through CI/CD pipelines. This ensures that updates are smoothly rolled out without disrupting service availability.

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

1. **Frontend Build Issues**: Ensure all node dependencies are up-to-date. Clearing cache (`npm cache clean --force`) can sometimes resolve mysterious issues.
2. **Backend Connection Errors**: Verify that Gunicorn workers are correctly configured and not overwhelmed by requests. Scaling up workers or optimizing code can help mitigate these issues.
3. **Database Access Control**: If facing permission issues with Supabase/PostgreSQL, check that row-level security policies are correctly defined.
4. **Task Queue Delays**: Ensure Redis Queue workers are alive and monitoring tools are set up correctly to alert on worker heartbeats failure.
5. **Deployment Failures**: Review Render.com deployment logs for any errors during build or deployment processes; often these logs provide direct hints towards what needs fixing.
