# Testing Sentry `trace_id` in MorningAI

Sentry is an essential tool for monitoring and fixing crashes in real-time, providing developers with insights into errors and performance issues. Understanding how to test and use Sentry's `trace_id` within the MorningAI platform can significantly enhance debugging efficiency and error tracking. This FAQ aims to guide developers through the process of testing the Sentry `trace_id`.

## Understanding Sentry `trace_id`

The `trace_id` is a unique identifier used by Sentry to track individual requests or tasks across multiple systems, services, or microservices involved in generating a response or outcome. It helps in correlating logs, errors, and performance metrics for a single operation, making it easier to diagnose issues.

### How to Use `trace_id` in MorningAI

In the context of MorningAI, every task or request can be tracked using Sentry's `trace_id`, allowing developers to monitor the flow through the platform's components such as the autonomous agent system, documentation management, and multi-platform integration.

#### Code Example: Generating and Logging `trace_id`

```python
import sentry_sdk

def initialize_sentry():
    sentry_sdk.init(
        dsn="your_sentry_dsn_here",
        traces_sample_rate=1.0  # Adjust sample rate as needed
    )

def log_with_trace():
    with sentry_sdk.start_transaction(op="test", name="Test Operation"):
        # Your code logic here
        trace_id = sentry_sdk.Hub.current.scope.transaction.trace_id
        print(f"Current trace ID: {trace_id}")
```

Ensure you replace `"your_sentry_dsn_here"` with your actual Sentry DSN. This example demonstrates how to start a transaction, which is necessary for generating a `trace_id`, and then retrieve and log that ID.

### Common Troubleshooting Tips

- **Missing Trace IDs**: Ensure that Sentry is correctly initialized in your application startup script. Missing or incorrect initialization can lead to missing trace IDs.
- **Sampling Rate Issues**: If you're not seeing all expected traces, check your sampling rate. A low sampling rate might result in fewer transactions being tracked.
- **Incorrect DSN Configuration**: Verify that your Sentry DSN is correctly configured in your environment. An incorrect DSN means no data being sent to Sentry.
- **Check for Integration Errors**: Ensure that all parts of your system integrated with Sentry are correctly configured to propagate or generate their own `trace_id` as needed.

Remember, testing and configuring Sentry within MorningAI not only aids in real-time error tracking but also improves overall system observability. By leveraging the `trace_id`, developers can more efficiently pinpoint where issues are occurring within complex workflows.
