# System Architecture of MorningAI

The system architecture of MorningAI is designed to support a scalable, efficient, and robust SaaS platform for autonomous code generation, FAQ generation, documentation management, and multi-platform integration. This architecture leverages a microservices approach, integrating various technologies such as React, Python Flask, PostgreSQL (Supabase), Redis Queue (RQ), and OpenAI GPT-4 to deliver a seamless experience.

## Overview

At its core, the MorningAI platform consists of the following components:

- **Frontend**: Developed with React, leveraging Vite for build optimization and TailwindCSS for styling. The frontend is responsible for delivering a responsive user interface and interacting with the backend services.
  
- **Backend**: Built with Python using the Flask framework and deployed with Gunicorn supporting multiple workers for handling concurrent requests efficiently. The backend handles business logic, API requests, and serves as an intermediary between the frontend and the database.

- **Database**: Utilizes PostgreSQL hosted on Supabase, which provides additional features like Row Level Security for enhanced data protection. The database stores all platform data including user information, task details, and generated content.

- **Queue System**: Implements Redis Queue (RQ) for task queuing and real-time task orchestration. This system allows asynchronous execution of resource-intensive tasks such as code generation and content processing.

- **Orchestration**: Uses LangGraph for managing agent workflows, ensuring tasks are executed in an orderly manner based on dependencies and priorities.

- **AI Integration**: Incorporates OpenAI GPT-4 for generating high-quality content across various functionalities within the platform.

- **Deployment**: Hosted on Render.com with continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines in place to automate deployment processes.

## Code Examples

### Flask Application Initialization
```python
from flask import Flask
from flask_cors import CORS
from config import Config

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config.from_object(Config)
CORS(app)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    from gunicorn.app.base import BaseApplication

    class Application(BaseApplication):
        def init(self, parser, opts, args):
            return {'bind': '0.0.0.0:8000', 'workers': 4}

        def load(self):
            return app

    Application().run()
```

### Redis Queue Task Example
```python
import redis
from rq import Queue

redis_conn = redis.Redis()
q = Queue(connection=redis_conn)

def background_task(arg):
    print(f"Task running with argument {arg}!")
    return f"Task completed with argument {arg}"

job = q.enqueue(background_task, 'Example argument')
```

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

### Database Connection Issues
Ensure that your Supabase credentials are correct and that your IP address is whitelisted if necessary. Review your `DATABASE_URL` environment variable for correctness.

### Task Queuing Delays or Failures
Check the Redis server health and ensure it's running properly. Verify that RQ workers are online by inspecting their heartbeat status via the RQ dashboard or command line tools.

### Deployment Failures on Render.com
Review your build logs on Render.com to identify any errors during the build or deploy process. Ensure that all required environment variables are correctly set in your Render service configuration.
