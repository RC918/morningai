# Testing Sentry `trace_id` in MorningAI

In the context of MorningAI's development, understanding and utilizing Sentry's `trace_id` is crucial for debugging and improving the platform's reliability. This FAQ aims to guide developers through the process of testing and working with Sentry `trace_id` within the MorningAI ecosystem.

## What is Sentry's `trace_id`?

Sentry's `trace_id` is a unique identifier used to trace events and errors through the entire stack of an application. It enables developers to track down issues by correlating errors and performance problems with specific requests or operations. This is particularly useful in distributed systems like MorningAI, where tracing requests across multiple services and components can be challenging.

## How to Test Sentry `trace_id` in MorningAI

To test Sentry's `trace_id` within the MorningAI platform, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Configuration

Ensure your local or development environment is correctly set up to send data to Sentry. This involves configuring your Sentry DSN (Data Source Name) in the environment variables or configuration files of the project.

For example, in your `.env` file, you might have:

```plaintext
SENTRY_DSN=your_sentry_dsn_here
```

And in your Flask application initialization (`app/__init__.py`):

```python
from flask import Flask
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.flask import FlaskIntegration

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn=os.getenv("SENTRY_DSN"),
    integrations=[FlaskIntegration()],
    traces_sample_rate=1.0 # Capture 100% of transactions for performance monitoring.
)
```

### Step 2: Generating Errors or Performance Issues

To test tracing, you can manually generate errors or simulate performance issues within your code. For example, introducing a deliberate error in one of your route handlers:

```python
@app.route('/error')
def trigger_error():
    division_by_zero = 1 / 0
    return "This won't be executed."
```

Or simulating a slow API call:

```python
import time

@app.route('/slow')
def slow_response():
    time.sleep(10) # Simulate a slow response
    return "This was slow."
```

### Step 3: Tracing with `trace_id`

When an error occurs, or a performance issue is logged, check your Sentry dashboard for the event. Each event will have a `trace_id` associated with it. You can use this ID to trace back through logs or other telemetry data in your system that corresponds to the same operation.

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

- **Missing events in Sentry**: Ensure that your Sentry DSN is correctly configured and that your environment permits outgoing HTTP requests to Sentry's servers.
- **Sampling rate too low**: If you notice not all transactions are captured, you might want to adjust the `traces_sample_rate`. A rate of `1.0` captures 100% of transactions but may increase costs.
- **Incorrectly configured integrations**: Double-check that you've added all necessary integrations for Sentry within your application initialization code. Missing integrations can lead to incomplete traces.

Testing and utilizing Sentry's `trace_id` effectively allows developers on the MorningAI platform to pinpoint issues quickly, ensuring robustness and reliability across services.
