# MorningAI System Architecture

Understanding the system architecture of MorningAI is essential for developers looking to integrate, extend, or troubleshoot the platform. The architecture is designed to support scalable, efficient, and real-time operations across various services, including autonomous code generation, FAQ management, and multi-platform integration.

## Overview

MorningAI leverages a microservices architecture built on a robust stack that includes React, Flask, Gunicorn, PostgreSQL (via Supabase), Redis Queue (RQ), and OpenAI's GPT-4 for AI-driven functionalities. The system is orchestrated using LangGraph and deployed on Render.com with continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD).

### Frontend

The frontend is developed using React along with Vite for fast builds and TailwindCSS for styling. This combination allows for a highly responsive and visually appealing user interface that can be rapidly developed and iterated upon.

**Code Example: Initializing a React Component**

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import './index.css';

function App() {
  return <div className="app">Welcome to MorningAI</div>;
}

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

### Backend

The backend infrastructure uses Python with Flask as the web framework and Gunicorn as the WSGI HTTP server. It is configured for multi-worker support to handle concurrent requests efficiently.

**Code Example: Flask Application Setup**

```python
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello, MorningAI!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

### Database

MorningAI utilizes PostgreSQL for data storage, with Supabase adding a layer of real-time capabilities and Row Level Security (RLS) for data integrity and access control.

**Code Example: Supabase Integration**

```python
from supabase import create_client, Client

url: str = "https://your-supabase-project-url.supabase.co"
key: str = "your-supabase-key"
supabase: Client = create_client(url, key)

response = supabase.table("your_table").select("*").execute()
data = response.data
```

### Queue System

Task orchestration and real-time operations are handled by Redis Queue (RQ), enabling asynchronous task processing to improve the platform's efficiency.

**Code Example: Enqueueing a Task with RQ**

```python
from redis import Redis
from rq import Queue

redis_conn = Redis()
q = Queue(connection=redis_conn)

result = q.enqueue('my_module.my_function', args=(my_arg,), timeout=600)
```

### AI Integration

OpenAI's GPT-4 powers the autonomous agent system and content generation features within MorningAI. This integration allows for sophisticated code generation and natural language processing capabilities.

**Code Example: Using GPT-4 with OpenAI API**

```python
import openai

openai.api_key = 'your-api-key'

response = openai.Completion.create(
  engine="gpt-4",
  prompt="Generate FAQ content for a SaaS platform:",
  temperature=0.5,
  max_tokens=1000
)

print(response.choices[0].text)
```

### Deployment and Orchestration

Deployment is managed via Render.com, supporting seamless CI/CD workflows. LangGraph orchestrates agent workflows, ensuring efficient task execution across different services.

## Troubleshooting Tips

- **Frontend Issues**: Ensure dependencies are up to date with `npm install` or `yarn install`. Check console logs for errors.
- **Backend Connectivity**: Verify Flask application logs for errors. Ensure Gunicorn is properly configured for worker processes.
- **Database Access**: Confirm RLS policies in Supabase do not inadvertently block legitimate queries. Review connection strings.
- **Queue System**: Monitor Redis Queue dashboard for failed jobs. Ensure workers are running and have sufficient resources.
- **Deployment Errors**: Check Render.com deployment logs for any build or deployment issues. Validate environment variables are correctly set.
