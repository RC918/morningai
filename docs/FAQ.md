# Testing Sentry Trace ID in MorningAI

When integrating Sentry into your development workflow with MorningAI, one crucial feature you'll often utilize is the `trace_id`. This identifier helps in tracing errors and performance issues across different parts of your application. Understanding how to test and validate the `trace_id` is essential for effective debugging and monitoring.

## What is a Sentry Trace ID?

A `trace_id` in Sentry is a unique identifier used to track individual transactions or series of transactions across services. It plays a critical role in distributed tracing, allowing developers to follow the path of a request through various microservices or functions in an application.

## How to Test Sentry Trace ID in MorningAI

To effectively test and use Sentry's `trace_id` within the MorningAI platform, follow these steps:

### 1. Configuration

Ensure that your MorningAI project has Sentry properly configured. This involves setting up Sentry SDK with your DSN (Data Source Name) in the project settings. In your Flask app (`app.py`), initialize Sentry like this:

```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.flask import FlaskIntegration

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="your_sentry_dsn_here",
    integrations=[FlaskIntegration()],
    traces_sample_rate=1.0  # Adjust sample rate as needed
)
```

### 2. Generating and Using `trace_id`

Whenever an error or transaction is captured by Sentry, it assigns a `trace_id`. You can programmatically access this ID by tapping into the current scope of Sentry. Here's how you can log or use this ID within your Python code:

```python
from sentry_sdk import Hub

current_scope = Hub.current.scope
if current_scope.span:
    trace_id = current_scope.span.trace_id
    print(f"Current Trace ID: {trace_id}")
```

### 3. Testing with Mock Transactions

For testing purposes, you can create a mock route in your Flask application that intentionally generates an error or transaction to be tracked by Sentry:

```python
@app.route('/test-sentry')
def test_sentry():
    try:
        # Simulate an error/exception
        1 / 0
    except Exception as e:
        # Explicitly capture exception to get trace_id
        event_id = sentry_sdk.capture_exception(e)
        trace_info = sentry_sdk.Hub.current.last_event_id()
        return f"Error captured with Event ID: {event_id}, Trace Info: {trace_info}"
```

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

- **Missing Trace IDs**: Ensure that `traces_sample_rate` is set above 0 in your Sentry initialization to capture transactions.
- **Incorrect DSN Configuration**: Double-check your DSN in the Sentry initialization block; incorrect DSN can lead to failed event captures.
- **Network Issues**: Sentry requires an active internet connection to send data. Ensure your environment has network access if events are not appearing.
- **Rate Limits**: If you're sending too many requests to Sentry, you might hit rate limits, leading to dropped events. Review your usage against your plan's limits.

By following these guidelines and utilizing the provided examples, developers should be able to effectively test and work with Sentry's `trace_id` within the MorningAI platform for better error tracking and resolution.
