# Testing Sentry `trace_id` in MorningAI

When integrating Sentry with MorningAI, it's crucial to ensure that the `trace_id` is correctly configured and operational. This allows for effective monitoring and debugging by tracking errors and performance issues within the application. This FAQ section will guide you through understanding, testing, and troubleshooting the `trace_id` within the MorningAI platform.

## Understanding `trace_id`

The `trace_id` is a unique identifier used by Sentry to trace events through the system. It links errors and transactions, enabling developers to see what happened during an error or performance issue. In the context of MorningAI, this means being able to trace how a specific piece of code or operation behaves across different services and requests.

### How to Test `trace_id` in MorningAI

Testing the `trace_id` involves generating an error or a transaction intentionally and then verifying that it appears in Sentry with the correct identifier. Here's a simple Python Flask route example that could be added to your application for testing purposes:

```python
from flask import Flask, jsonify
import sentry_sdk

app = Flask(__name__)

sentry_sdk.init(dsn="your_sentry_dsn_here")

@app.route('/test-sentry')
def test_sentry():
    try:
        # Intentionally raise an exception to test Sentry integration
        raise ValueError("This is a test error for Sentry.")
    except Exception as e:
        sentry_sdk.capture_exception(e)
        return jsonify({"message": "Error sent to Sentry"}), 500

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()
```

Replace `"your_sentry_dsn_here"` with your actual Sentry DSN. This route intentionally raises an exception which is then captured by Sentry. You can trigger this by visiting `/test-sentry` on your deployed application.

### Common Troubleshooting Tips

**Issue**: The `trace_id` does not appear in Sentry.

**Solutions**:

1. **Check DSN Configuration**: Ensure that your DSN (Data Source Name) is correctly configured in your application. A wrong DSN means Sentry won't receive your data.
   
2. **Review Initialization Code**: Verify that `sentry_sdk.init()` is correctly placed and executed in your application setup.
   
3. **Check Network Issues**: Sometimes, network configurations or firewalls might block requests from reaching Sentry servers.

4. **Sentry SDK Version**: Ensure you're using a recent version of the Sentry SDK compatible with your application stack.

5. **Logging Level**: Verify that your logging level isn't filtering out these messages before they reach Sentry.
