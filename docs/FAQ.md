# MorningAI System Architecture

The MorningAI platform is designed as a robust, scalable multi-tenant SaaS solution aimed at streamlining autonomous code generation, FAQ documentation management, and providing seamless integration across multiple messaging platforms. Its architecture is crafted to support real-time task orchestration and efficient memory storage for a seamless user experience.

## Overview

MorningAI leverages a microservices architecture, with each component designed to operate both independently and in concert with others. This approach ensures scalability, reliability, and easy maintenance. Below is an outline of the key components and technologies that constitute the MorningAI system architecture:

### Frontend

- **Technology Stack**: The user interface is built using React for its reusable components and state management features, Vite for fast builds, and TailwindCSS for styling.
- **Code Example**:
  ```jsx
  // src/App.jsx
  import React from 'react';
  import 'tailwindcss/tailwind.css';

  function App() {
    return <div className="app">Welcome to MorningAI</div>;
  }

  export default App;
  ```

### Backend

- **Technology Stack**: The server-side logic is handled by Python using the Flask framework for its simplicity and flexibility. Gunicorn serves as the WSGI HTTP Server for UNIX, supporting multi-worker connections.
- **Configuration Example**:
  ```python
  # gunicorn_config.py
  workers = 2
  threads = 4
  bind = "0.0.0.0:8000"
  ```
- **Running Gunicorn**:
  ```bash
  gunicorn -c gunicorn_config.py myapp:app
  ```

### Database

- **Technology Stack**: PostgreSQL is utilized for data storage, augmented with Row Level Security (RLS) for enhanced data protection. Supabase extends PostgreSQL, offering additional features like pgvector for vector memory storage.
- **Supabase Setup**:
    - Create a new project on Supabase.io.
    - Navigate to the SQL Editor and execute custom SQL commands to configure RLS and pgvector.

### Queue System

- **Redis Queue (RQ)**: Facilitates task queuing and worker management to handle background processes efficiently.
- **Worker Configuration**:
    ```python
    # worker.py
    from redis import Redis
    from rq import Worker, Queue, Connection

    listen = ['high', 'default', 'low']

    redis_conn = Redis()

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        with Connection(redis_conn):
            worker = Worker(map(Queue, listen))
            worker.work()
    ```

### Orchestration & AI

- **LangGraph**: Used for orchestrating agent workflows in a flexible manner.
- **OpenAI GPT-4**: Powers content generation including code snippets and FAQ documentation.
  
### Deployment

- Deployed on Render.com with continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD), ensuring automatic updates from the repository `RC918/morningai` to production environments.

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

1. **Issue**: Flask application not starting under Gunicorn.
   - **Solution**: Ensure that Gunicorn is correctly configured with the right number of workers and binds to the correct port as specified in your `gunicorn_config.py`.

2. **Issue**: Tasks not being processed by Redis Queue workers.
   - **Solution**: Verify that Redis is running and accessible by your application. Also, ensure workers are correctly started with the right queues being listened to.

3. **Issue**: Database migrations failing in Supabase.
   - **Solution**: Review your SQL scripts for compatibility issues with PostgreSQL versions supported by Supabase. Ensure all foreign keys and relationships are correctly defined.
