# System Architecture of MorningAI

MorningAI is designed as a multi-tenant SaaS platform leveraging a robust and scalable architecture. It integrates advanced features such as autonomous agent systems for code generation, dynamic FAQ generation, documentation management, multi-platform integration, real-time task orchestration, and vector memory storage. This section provides a comprehensive overview of MorningAI's system architecture to help developers understand and utilize its capabilities effectively.

## Core Components

### Frontend

- **Technology Stack**: The frontend is built using React with Vite as the build tool and TailwindCSS for styling.
- **Path**: `frontend/` within the repository.
- **Key Features**: Interactive UIs, real-time data presentation, and seamless integration with backend services.

### Backend

- **Technology Stack**: The backend employs Python with Flask serving as the web framework and Gunicorn as the WSGI HTTP server with multi-worker support for handling concurrent requests efficiently.
- **Path**: `backend/` within the repository.
- **Key Services**:
  - Autonomous agent system: Utilizes OpenAI's GPT-4 for intelligent code generation and content creation.
  - Documentation management: Offers tools for creating, updating, and managing FAQs and documentation.
  - Multi-platform integration: Supports messaging platforms like Telegram, LINE, Messenger for broader accessibility.
  - Task orchestration: Employs LangGraph for managing complex workflows among different agents.

### Database

- **Technology Stack**: PostgreSQL with an extension of pgvector via Supabase, enhanced with Row Level Security (RLS) for data protection.
- **Path**: Configuration details can be found under `database/config`.
- **Features**: Provides secure, scalable storage with vector support for efficient data retrieval and manipulation.

### Queue System

- **Technology Used**: Redis Queue (RQ) is utilized for managing tasks asynchronously, ensuring efficient processing of background tasks.
- **Configuration Path**: Check `queue/redis-config`.
- **Key Functionality**: Includes worker heartbeat monitoring to ensure reliability and fault tolerance in task execution.

### Orchestration & AI

- **Orchestration Tool**: LangGraph is used for defining and executing complex workflows among various components of the system.
- **AI Service**: GPT-4 from OpenAI powers the autonomous agent system for content generation and other AI-driven features.

### Deployment

- **Service**: Render.com is used for deploying the application, benefiting from its CI/CD capabilities to automate deployment processes.
- **Configuration Files**: Located under `.render/` directory in the repository.

## Code Examples

While specific code examples depend on the area of development focus, hereâ€™s a generic example on initiating a Flask application:

```python
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello, MorningAI!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

This snippet demonstrates setting up a basic Flask app. For more detailed examples tailored to specific components like database interaction or queue management, refer to the respective directories in the repository (`backend/`, `database/config`, `queue/`).

5. [Render.com CI/CD](https://render.com/docs/ci-cd)

## Troubleshooting Tips

1. **Backend Not Responding**:
   - Ensure Gunicorn is correctly configured with multiple workers to handle requests efficiently.
   - Verify connectivity to Redis Queue and PostgreSQL services.

2. **Database Connection Issues**:
   - Check PostgreSQL credentials and network access rules in Supabase settings.
   - Confirm that Row Level Security policies do not inadvertently block legitimate queries.

3. **Frontend Build Failures**:
   - Ensure all npm dependencies are correctly installed (`npm install`).
   - Verify Vite configuration for any environment-specific settings.
