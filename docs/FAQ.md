# E2E Test FAQ for MorningAI

End-to-End (E2E) testing is a critical component of ensuring the reliability and functionality of the MorningAI platform. It simulates real-user scenarios to validate the system as a whole, from the frontend through to the backend, database, and integration layers. This FAQ aims to guide developers on how to effectively utilize E2E tests within the MorningAI project.

## What is E2E Testing in MorningAI?

E2E testing in MorningAI involves automated testing strategies that simulate user behaviors against the platform to ensure all integrated components function as expected. This includes interactions with the React frontend, Flask backend, PostgreSQL database via Supabase, Redis Queue tasks, and any third-party integrations.

## How to Set Up E2E Tests?

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have Node.js installed for running JavaScript-based E2E tests.
- Install all project dependencies by navigating to your project directory and running `npm install`.

### Setting Up Test Environment

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RC918/morningai.git
   cd morningai
   ```

2. Install E2E testing tools like Cypress or Puppeteer. For Cypress, run:
   ```bash
   npm install cypress --save-dev
   ```

3. Configure your `.env` file with necessary environment variables for accessing the database, API keys, etc.

4. Prepare your test data and scripts based on realistic user scenarios that interact with MorningAI's features.

### Running E2E Tests

To execute your E2E tests using Cypress as an example:

```bash
npx cypress open
```
or for headless execution:
```bash
npx cypress run
```

## Code Example

Here's a simple example of an E2E test script using Cypress that tests user login functionality:

```javascript
describe('Login Test', () => {
  it('Visits the login page and logs in', () => {
    cy.visit('/login')
    cy.get('input[name=username]').type('testuser')
    cy.get('input[name=password]').type('password')
    cy.get('form').submit()
    cy.url().should('include', '/dashboard')
  })
})
```

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

- **Tests Failing Unexpectedly**: Ensure your environment variables are correctly set up and that external services (databases, third-party APIs) are accessible.
- **Timeouts or Slow Tests**: Adjust timeout settings within your testing framework. Consider mocking external services or databases if real interactions are not essential for certain tests.
- **Flaky Tests**: Try to isolate and identify any non-deterministic behavior in your tests or application code. Ensure you're waiting for necessary elements or responses before proceeding in your test scripts.

Remember, consistent, reliable E2E tests are invaluable for maintaining high-quality software. Regularly review and update your test cases to cover new features or changes within the platform.
