# Test Retry Success in MorningAI

Understanding how to manage test retries successfully is crucial for maintaining the reliability and efficiency of code within the MorningAI platform. This document aims to provide developers with insights on implementing and troubleshooting test retries.

## Comprehensive Explanation

In software testing, especially in an environment like MorningAI that involves real-time data processing and AI operations, tests might fail due to transient issues such as network latency, dependencies on external services, or temporary resource unavailability. Implementing a retry mechanism for tests can help mitigate these issues by attempting to run the test multiple times before marking it as failed, thus reducing false negatives.

MorningAI leverages a variety of technologies where test retries can be particularly useful, including integration tests involving Redis Queue (RQ) tasks, database operations with PostgreSQL (Supabase), and interactions with AI models.

### Implementation

Test retries can be implemented using various testing frameworks and libraries. For Python-based backend services in MorningAI, the `pytest` framework with the `pytest-rerunfailures` plugin is commonly used.

#### Example: Pytest with pytest-rerunfailures

First, ensure you have `pytest` and `pytest-rerunfailures` installed:

```bash
pip install pytest pytest-rerunfailures
```

Next, you can specify the number of times you want a test to rerun upon failure directly in your pytest command:

```bash
pytest --reruns 3
```

This command will rerun any failing tests up to 3 times before marking them as failed.

For specific tests that interact with external services or involve network calls, you can use decorators to indicate retries:

```python
import pytest

@pytest.mark.flaky(reruns=5, reruns_delay=2)
def test_integration_with_external_service():
    # Your test code here that interacts with an external service
    assert call_to_external_service() == expected_response
```

In this example, `reruns=5` specifies that the test should be retried up to 5 times if it fails, with `reruns_delay=2` adding a 2-second pause between each retry attempt.

### Common Troubleshooting Tips

1. **Transient Dependencies**: Ensure that the failures are genuinely transient. If a service your test depends on is consistently unavailable or slow, consider mocking that service or increasing the retry delay.
2. **Resource Saturation**: Be mindful of resource saturation on retries. Repeatedly running resource-intensive tests could exacerbate the problem. Monitor system resources during test runs.
3. **Proper Cleanup**: Ensure each test cleans up after itself properly to avoid state contamination between retries.
4. **Rerun Configuration**: Adjusting the number of reruns and delay based on historical data can help find a balance between catching transient errors and not overloading your testing pipeline.

Implementing a robust retry mechanism for tests in MorningAI not only improves reliability but also ensures smoother development and deployment cycles by reducing false negatives due to transient issues.
