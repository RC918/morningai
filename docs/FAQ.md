# Testing Sentry `trace_id` in MorningAI

Sentry is an open-source error tracking tool that helps developers monitor and fix crashes in real time. In the context of MorningAI, Sentry's `trace_id` is crucial for debugging and tracing errors across distributed systems, ensuring a smooth operation and quick resolution of issues.

## Understanding `trace_id`

A `trace_id` is a unique identifier for each trace or request that Sentry tracks. It ties together a series of events that represent a single user's journey or a transaction across the system. By leveraging `trace_id`, developers can pinpoint where failures occur in the application flow, understand the impact, and trace them back to their origins.

## How to Test `trace_id` in MorningAI

Testing `trace_id` within MorningAI involves generating and tracking an error or transaction, then locating this via Sentry's dashboard using the `trace_id`. Here’s how you can simulate this:

### Step 1: Generate an Error

You can generate a test error in your local development environment or within a staging environment. For instance, if you're working with Python Flask (as used in MorningAI's backend), you might deliberately throw an exception:

```python
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/trigger-error')
def trigger_error():
    raise ValueError('This is a test error for Sentry tracing.')
```

### Step 2: Capture the Trace ID

When Sentry captures an error, it assigns a `trace_id`. To retrieve and log this ID, you could use Sentry’s SDK. Ensure Sentry is configured correctly in your Flask application:

```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.flask import FlaskIntegration

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="your_sentry_dsn_here",
    integrations=[FlaskIntegration()],
    traces_sample_rate=1.0 # Adjust sampling rate as needed
)

@app.route('/capture-trace-id')
def capture_trace_id():
    with sentry_sdk.push_scope() as scope:
        # Simulate an error or critical transaction
        try:
            # Your code logic here
            pass
        except Exception as e:
            sentry_sdk.capture_exception(e)
            return scope.span.trace_id
```

### Step 3: Locate the Trace ID in Sentry

After triggering an error and capturing its trace ID, log into your Sentry dashboard. Use the search function to find the specific event using its `trace_id`. This will bring up all related events and transactions, providing a comprehensive view of what happened before and after the error occurred.

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

- **Missing Trace IDs**: Ensure that your Sentry SDK is properly initialized with your DSN (Data Source Name) and that you have enabled tracing by setting a sample rate.
- **No Errors Captured**: Verify that your environment (development, staging, production) has access to the internet and can communicate with Sentry's servers.
- **Incorrect Trace Information**: Make sure that the version of Sentry SDK you are using supports tracing and is compatible with your application's technology stack.

Remember to remove any test errors or unnecessary logging before deploying your application to production to maintain optimal performance and security.
