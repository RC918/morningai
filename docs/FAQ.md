# How to Use the Autonomous Agent System for Code Generation in MorningAI

The MorningAI platform offers a sophisticated autonomous agent system designed to streamline the code generation process. This feature leverages advanced AI algorithms to help developers automate coding tasks, reduce errors, and increase efficiency. Understanding how to utilize this system can significantly enhance your development workflow within the MorningAI ecosystem.

## Comprehensive Explanation

The autonomous agent system in MorningAI is built on top of OpenAI's GPT-4, providing a powerful tool for generating code across various programming languages and frameworks. It integrates seamlessly with the platform's multi-tenant SaaS architecture, offering a unique combination of flexibility, scalability, and intelligence in code generation.

### Key Features:
- **Multi-language support**: Generate code in multiple programming languages including Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, and more.
- **Context-aware generation**: The system understands the context of your project to provide relevant code snippets.
- **Integration-friendly**: Easily integrate generated code with existing projects through MorningAI's multi-platform support.

## Code Examples

Here's how to initiate a simple code generation request using the autonomous agent system in a Python Flask application. Ensure you have Flask installed in your environment:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import morningai.agent as agent

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/generate_code', methods=['POST'])
def generate_code():
    data = request.json
    language = data.get('language')
    prompt = data.get('prompt')
    
    generated_code = agent.generate_code(language=language, prompt=prompt)
    
    return jsonify({
        'generated_code': generated_code
    })

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

### Setup Instructions:

1. **Clone the repository**: Start by cloning the RC918/morningai repository to your local machine.
2. **Install dependencies**: Navigate into your cloned directory and install necessary dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. **Environment Configuration**: Ensure you have set up all required environment variables as documented in `docs/setup.md`.
4. **Run the application**: Start your Flask application by running `flask run` from your terminal.
