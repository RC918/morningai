# Test Retry Success in MorningAI

Understanding and implementing test retries in MorningAI is crucial for ensuring the reliability and robustness of your application. This guide provides comprehensive insights into the test retry mechanism, helping developers effectively utilize this feature within the MorningAI platform.

## Understanding Test Retries

Test retries are a mechanism that allows a test that has failed to be automatically re-executed a certain number of times before being marked as a definitive failure. This is particularly useful in scenarios where tests might fail intermittently due to external dependencies or transient issues such as network latency or resource contention.

In MorningAI, test retries can be configured at various levels including individual tests, suites, or globally across all tests. This flexibility ensures that critical tests can be given more retry attempts to mitigate the impact of flaky failures on your CI/CD pipeline's stability.

### Configuration

To configure test retries in MorningAI, you will need to modify your test runner configuration. Assuming you're using pytest with Flask, here's an example of how you might set up retries:

```python
# In your conftest.py or a dedicated config file
def pytest_addoption(parser):
    parser.addoption("--retry", action="store", default=1, help="Number of times to retry failing tests")

def pytest_runtest_setup(item):
    retry_count = item.config.getoption("--retry")
    if retry_count > 1:
        plugin = item.config.pluginmanager.getplugin("flaky")
        plugin.add_flaky_marker(item.nodeid, max_runs=retry_count)
```

This example adds a command-line option `--retry` to control the number of retries for failing tests. The `pytest_runtest_setup` function checks for this option and applies the necessary configuration to each test.

### Usage

To use test retries with the above configuration, run your pytest command as follows:

```bash
pytest --retry=3
```

This command tells pytest to retry any failing tests up to 3 times before marking them as failures.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

When implementing test retries, several common issues may arise:

- **Flaky Tests Becoming Invisible**: Over-relying on retries can mask issues with flaky tests. Ensure that retries are used judiciously and that flaky tests are ultimately fixed rather than ignored.
- **Incorrect Configuration**: Ensure that your configuration changes are correctly applied. Double-check `conftest.py` or wherever your retry logic is defined.
- **Dependency on Test Order**: If your tests have dependencies on the order they are run (which should be avoided), retries might introduce unexpected behavior. Make sure each test is independent.

By understanding how to configure and use test retries within MorningAI, developers can improve their testing strategy's resilience against transient failures, leading to more stable builds and deployments.
