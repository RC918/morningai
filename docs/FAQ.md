# Test Retry Mechanism in MorningAI

In the context of developing and maintaining robust applications, ensuring that transient errors do not disrupt the overall functionality is crucial. The MorningAI platform employs a test retry mechanism to handle such scenarios gracefully, enhancing reliability and stability during testing phases. This section aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how test retries are implemented within the MorningAI platform, including practical code examples, related documentation, and troubleshooting tips.

## Understanding Test Retries

Test retries in MorningAI are designed to automatically re-execute tests that fail due to transient issues such as temporary network glitches, dependency downtime, or flaky test cases. This mechanism helps in distinguishing between transient and consistent failures, ensuring that the latter can be addressed by developers promptly.

### Configuration

MorningAI utilizes a flexible configuration system for test retries, allowing developers to specify the number of retry attempts and criteria for retries (e.g., specific error types). This configuration is typically defined in the test framework settings or annotations within test cases.

#### Example Configuration

Suppose you're using Pytest with the `pytest-rerunfailures` plugin for Python testing in MorningAI. You could configure retries as follows:

```python
# In pytest.ini or conftest.py
[pytest]
addopts = --reruns 3 --reruns-delay 5
```

This configuration instructs Pytest to rerun failed tests up to three times with a delay of 5 seconds between attempts.

### Code Example: Implementing Retry Logic

For tasks beyond testing scenarios, such as operations in task queues or database transactions, implementing custom retry logic might be necessary. Hereâ€™s a simple example using Python's `retrying` package:

```python
from retrying import retry

@retry(wait_fixed=2000, stop_max_attempt_number=3)
def perform_sensitive_operation():
    # Code that might fail transiently, e.g., network request or DB operation
    pass

try:
    perform_sensitive_operation()
except RetryError:
    # Handle the case where all retries have failed
    pass
```

This snippet retries the `perform_sensitive_operation` function up to three times with a 2-second wait between attempts.

## Troubleshooting Tips

1. **Tests Still Failing After Maximum Retries**: Investigate if the issue is indeed transient. Review logs and consider increasing the wait time between retries.
2. **Retry Configuration Not Taking Effect**: Ensure that your test framework supports retries natively or through plugins. Verify that configuration files are correctly placed and syntax is accurate.
3. **Performance Impact Due to Retries**: Analyze whether retries are causing significant delays in your CI pipeline. Adjust retry count and delay timings as needed.
4. **Determining Whether to Retry**: For custom implementations, carefully select conditions under which retries should occur to avoid masking persistent issues.

Test retries are an essential part of maintaining high-quality software by ensuring that temporary problems do not lead to false negatives in testing outcomes. Properly configuring and managing this mechanism can save significant time and resources while keeping your application stable and reliable.
