# Testing Sentry `trace_id` in MorningAI

When integrating Sentry with MorningAI, it's crucial to understand how to test and utilize the `trace_id` for debugging and tracking errors efficiently. This FAQ entry aims to guide developers through the process of testing Sentry `trace_id` within the MorningAI platform.

## Understanding `trace_id`

Sentry uses `trace_id` as part of its tracing system to follow the path of a request across different services. This is particularly useful in a distributed system like MorningAI, where a single request can touch many microservices. The `trace_id` helps in aggregating and connecting events and logs that belong to a single transaction or request.

## How to Test Sentry `trace_id`

To test Sentry `trace_id`, you'll need to ensure that Sentry is correctly integrated into your MorningAI application. Here's a simple step-by-step guide:

### Step 1: Ensure Proper Sentry Setup

Ensure your Sentry DSN (Data Source Name) is correctly configured in your MorningAI environment. Typically, this involves setting an environment variable or updating your configuration file:

```python
# Example: Configuring Sentry DSN in Flask (backend/config.py)
SENTRY_DSN = "your_sentry_dsn_here"
```

### Step 2: Generate a Transaction with `trace_id`

When initiating any transaction or request within MorningAI that you wish to track, include Sentry instrumentation code. For example, in Python (Flask):

```python
from flask import Flask
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.flask import FlaskIntegration

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="your_sentry_dsn_here",
    integrations=[FlaskIntegration()],
)

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    # Simulate an error for testing purposes
    division_by_zero = 1 / 0
    return 'Hello, World!'
```

### Step 3: Retrieve and Use the `trace_id`

After triggering an error or event that is captured by Sentry, you can find the `trace_id` in the Sentry issue details page under "Tags" or within the event JSON.

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

- **Missing `trace_id`**: Ensure that tracing is enabled and correctly configured in both your Sentry settings and within your application.
- **Incorrect DSN Configuration**: Double-check that your DSN is correctly placed and matches what's provided in your Sentry project settings.
- **Errors Not Showing in Sentry**: Verify network connectivity and that there are no firewall rules blocking communication with Sentry servers. Also, ensure that your Sentry quota has not been exceeded.

Remember, when testing integrations like these, it's often helpful to work in a staging environment before deploying changes to production. This approach minimizes potential disruptions and allows for safer experimentation.
