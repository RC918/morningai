# Test Retry Success in MorningAI

Understanding how to handle and implement test retries within the MorningAI platform is crucial for maintaining a robust and resilient development cycle. This FAQ aims to provide developers with the knowledge necessary to effectively use test retries to ensure the reliability of their code before deployment.

## Understanding Test Retries

Test retries are a mechanism used to automatically rerun failed tests before marking them as failures. This feature is particularly useful in environments where tests may fail intermittently due to external factors such as network latency, resource contention, or temporary service outages. Implementing test retries can help in identifying flaky tests and ensuring that only genuine failures are flagged for further investigation.

### How to Implement Test Retries

MorningAI utilizes a combination of tools and frameworks that support test retries. Given our stack includes Python with Flask and Gunicorn for the backend, an example of implementing test retries would be using `pytest` with its `pytest-rerunfailures` plugin.

1. **Install pytest-rerunfailures:**

```bash
pip install pytest-rerunfailures
```

2. **Configure Test Retries:**

In your `pytest.ini`, `tox.ini`, or `pyproject.toml` file, specify the number of times you want to rerun failed tests:

```ini
[pytest]
addopts = --reruns 3
```

This configuration will retry each failing test up to three times before marking it as a failure.

3. **Running Tests:**

Run your tests as you normally would. The rerun configuration will automatically apply:

```bash
pytest your_test_directory/
```

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

- **Ensure Compatibility:** Verify that all dependencies, especially `pytest` and `pytest-rerunfailures`, are updated and compatible with each other.
- **Analyze Failures:** If tests continue to fail even after retries, carefully analyze the logs and error messages to understand why they're failing. Persistent failures could indicate a deeper issue with the codebase or dependencies.
- **Monitor Performance:** Be mindful of how test retries might affect your overall testing time and CI/CD pipeline performance. Adjust the number of retries based on your project's needs and resource availability.

Implementing test retries in MorningAI's development process can greatly enhance the stability and reliability of deployments by ensuring that only genuine failures are highlighted for correction. By following the steps outlined above, developers can effectively manage flaky tests, leading to smoother development cycles and more reliable software releases.
