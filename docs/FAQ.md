# System Architecture of MorningAI

MorningAI leverages a robust and scalable architecture designed to provide efficient autonomous agent-based code generation, documentation management, and multi-platform integration. This architecture is built to handle real-time task orchestration and vector memory storage efficiently. Below is a detailed overview of the MorningAI system architecture, including its components and how they interact within the ecosystem.

## Overview

The MorningAI platform is structured around several key technologies and frameworks, each chosen for its performance, scalability, and compatibility with the other components in the system. The architecture can be broken down into the following main components:

- **Frontend**: Developed with React, leveraging Vite for an optimized development experience and TailwindCSS for styling.
- **Backend**: Utilizes Python with Flask as the web framework and Gunicorn as the WSGI HTTP Server with multi-worker support for handling concurrent requests efficiently.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL provided via Supabase with Row Level Security (RLS) for secure data access at the row level.
- **Queue System**: Redis Queue (RQ) is used for task queuing to manage background jobs with worker heartbeat monitoring to ensure reliability.
- **Orchestration**: LangGraph is utilized for orchestrating agent workflows, ensuring tasks are executed in an efficient and orderly manner.
- **AI Integration**: Integrates OpenAI's GPT-4 for advanced content generation capabilities.
- **Deployment**: Hosted on Render.com with continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines in place.

### Code Examples

#### Backend Setup Example

```python
from flask import Flask
from gunicorn.app.base import BaseApplication

class GunicornApplication(BaseApplication):
    def __init__(self, app, options=None):
        self.options = options or {}
        self.application = app
        super().__init__()

    def load_config(self):
        config = {key: value for key, value in self.options.items()
                  if key in self.cfg.settings and value is not None}
        for key, value in config.items():
            self.cfg.set(key.lower(), value)

    def load(self):
        return self.application

app = Flask(__name__)

# Application configuration here

if __name__ == "__main__":
    options = {
        'bind': '0.0.0.0:8000',
        'workers': 4,
    }
    GunicornApplication(app, options).run()
```

### Common Troubleshooting Tips

#### Database Connection Issues
Ensure that your Supabase credentials are correctly configured in your application settings. Verify network accessibility to the Supabase server from your application environment.

#### Worker Heartbeat Monitoring Failures
Check the Redis server's health and connectivity if workers are failing to report their heartbeats. Ensure that RQ workers are configured correctly and have sufficient permissions to access the Redis queue.

#### Deployment Failures on Render.com
Review the build logs provided by Render.com to identify any errors during the build or deployment process. Ensure that all environment variables required by your application are correctly set up in the Render dashboard.
