# Handling a Redis Outage in MorningAI

During the operation of MorningAI, a Redis outage can significantly impact the platform's real-time task orchestration and queue management functionalities. This FAQ aims to provide developers with guidance on how to understand, manage, and mitigate issues arising from a Redis outage within the MorningAI environment.

## Understanding the Impact of a Redis Outage

Redis, being an integral part of MorningAI's task queue system via Redis Queue (RQ), is crucial for managing background jobs that are essential for code generation, multi-platform integration, and real-time task execution. An outage can lead to:

- Delay or failure in executing queued tasks.
- Inability to add new tasks to the queue.
- Potential data inconsistency or loss if not properly handled.

### Code Example: Checking Redis Connection Health

```python
import redis
from rq import Connection, Worker

def check_redis_connection():
    try:
        r = redis.Redis()
        r.ping()  # Attempt to ping the Redis server
        print("Redis connection is healthy.")
    except redis.RedisError:
        print("Failed to connect to Redis.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    check_redis_connection()
```

This example demonstrates a simple way to check if your application can connect to the Redis server. Ensure this is periodically done or implemented as a health check within your application logic.

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

### 1. Verify Redis Service Status

Ensure that the Redis service is up and running. You can do this by using the command line on your server:

```bash
redis-cli ping
```

If Redis is running, you should receive a `PONG` response.

### 2. Check Network Connectivity

Sometimes, network issues can prevent your application from connecting to Redis. Ensure there are no firewall rules or network ACLs blocking access between your application servers and the Redis server.

### 3. Review Application Logs

Application logs can provide insights into why connections to Redis might be failing. Look for errors related to `RedisConnectionException` or timeouts.

### 4. Monitor for Overloading

High traffic can overload Redis, leading to slow responses or timeouts. Monitor metrics such as memory usage and command statistics to identify bottlenecks.

### 5. Failover Strategies

Implement failover strategies such as using a secondary (standby) Redis instance or temporarily queuing tasks in another storage system until the primary Redis instance is back online.

### 6. Contact Support

If you're using a managed Redis service (e.g., AWS ElastiCache, Google Cloud Memorystore), check the service's status page for outages and contact support for assistance.
