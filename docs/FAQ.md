# Testing Sentry Trace ID in MorningAI

## Overview
In the context of MorningAI, understanding and utilizing Sentry's `trace_id` is crucial for effective debugging and monitoring. Sentry is an error tracking tool that helps developers monitor and fix crashes in real-time. The `trace_id` is a unique identifier used to trace errors, transactions, and performance issues across distributed systems. This guide aims to help developers within the MorningAI platform, specifically within the `RC918/morningai` repository, to test and integrate Sentry's tracing capabilities.

## How to Use Sentry Trace ID

### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have access to the Sentry project linked with MorningAI.
- Make sure Sentry SDK is correctly set up in the project. If not, refer to [Sentry's official documentation](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/) for setup instructions.

### Integrating Sentry Trace ID
1. **Initialization**: First, ensure that Sentry is initialized in your application. For a Flask application within MorningAI, this can typically be done in your main app module or the factory function creating your app:

```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.flask import FlaskIntegration

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="your_sentry_dsn_here",
    integrations=[FlaskIntegration()],
    traces_sample_rate=1.0 # Adjust sampling rate as needed
)
```

2. **Capturing Errors**: To capture exceptions that occur in your Flask routes, simply use Flask's error handling mechanisms. Sentry will automatically capture these errors based on its integration:

```python
@app.errorhandler(500)
def handle_500(error):
    return "An internal error occurred.", 500
```

3. **Testing Trace ID**: To test the trace ID functionality, you can manually throw an exception in one of your endpoints and check if the error along with its trace ID appears in your Sentry dashboard:

```python
@app.route('/test-sentry')
def test_sentry():
    raise ValueError("This is a test error for Sentry")
```

### Retrieving and Using Trace IDs
When an error occurs, Sentry assigns a `trace_id` to the event. This ID can be found in the event's details page on the Sentry dashboard. It can be used to:
- Filter events in the dashboard.
- Link errors to specific transactions or logs for deeper analysis.

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

### Issue: Events Not Appearing in Sentry Dashboard
- **Check Your DSN**: Ensure that the DSN configured in your application matches what is provided by your Sentry project settings.
- **Review Sampling Rate**: A low traces sample rate might cause fewer events to be sent to Sentry. Increase `traces_sample_rate` as needed.
- **Network Issues**: Verify that there are no network issues preventing your application from sending events to Sentry.

### Issue: Missing Trace IDs
- **SDK Integration**: Make sure that all parts of your application are correctly integrated with Sentry SDK and that you're using supported versions.
- **Error Handling Mechanisms**: Ensure that errors are not being swallowed by custom error handlers without being reported to Sentry.
