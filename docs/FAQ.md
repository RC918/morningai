# System Architecture of MorningAI

The MorningAI platform is designed as a multi-tenant SaaS solution, aimed at automating code generation, managing FAQs and documentation, and facilitating multi-platform integration. The architecture is built to support real-time task orchestration and vector memory storage efficiently. Below is a detailed breakdown of the MorningAI system architecture, highlighting its key components, technology stack, and how they interact within the ecosystem.

## Key Components

### Frontend
- **Technology**: React with Vite and TailwindCSS for styling.
- **Path**: `/frontend/`
- **Description**: The frontend is developed using React for building user interfaces with Vite as the build tool for a faster and leaner development experience. TailwindCSS is used for styling, providing utility-first CSS classes for rapid UI development.

### Backend
- **Technology**: Python with Flask and Gunicorn.
- **Path**: `/backend/`
- **Description**: The backend is powered by Flask, a lightweight WSGI web application framework in Python, ensuring easy scalability and quick response times. Gunicorn serves as the WSGI HTTP Server for UNIX, enabling multi-worker support for handling concurrent user requests efficiently.

### Database
- **Technology**: PostgreSQL with Row Level Security via Supabase.
- **Path**: `/database/`
- **Description**: PostgreSQL serves as the primary database, integrated through Supabase to enhance security with row-level security (RLS) features. This setup ensures data integrity and secure access control across different tenants.

### Queue
- **Technology**: Redis Queue (RQ).
- **Path**: `/queue/`
- **Description**: Redis Queue is utilized for managing background tasks and real-time task orchestration. Worker heartbeat monitoring is implemented to ensure reliability and efficiency in task execution.

### Orchestration
- **Technology**: LangGraph.
- **Path**: `/orchestration/`
- **Description**: LangGraph orchestrates agent workflows within the platform. It manages dependencies between tasks and ensures that actions are executed in the correct order and context.

### AI
- **Technology**: OpenAI GPT-4.
- **Path**: `/ai/`
- **Description**: OpenAI's GPT-4 powers the autonomous agent system for code generation and content creation, including FAQ generation and documentation management.

### Deployment
- **Technology**: Render.com with CI/CD.
- **Path**: Not Applicable.
- **Description**: The entire infrastructure is deployed on Render.com, leveraging its capabilities for continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD), ensuring seamless updates and deployments.

## Code Examples

Given the diverse nature of technologies involved, specific code examples would depend on the component being addressed. For instance, initializing a Redis Queue in Python might look like this:

```python
from rq import Queue
from redis import Redis

redis_conn = Redis()
q = Queue(connection=redis_conn)

def background_task(n):
    """Function to simulate a background task that takes n seconds."""
    print(f"Task running with argument {n}")
    time.sleep(n)
    print("Task complete")

job = q.enqueue(background_task, 10)
```

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

1. **Flask/Gunicorn Setup Issues**:
   - Ensure Gunicorn is properly installed (`pip install gunicorn`) and workers are correctly configured in `gunicorn.config.py`.
2. **Redis Queue Connectivity**:
   - Verify that Redis server is running and accessible. Use `redis-cli ping` to check connectivity.
3. **Database Access Control**:
   - Confirm that Row Level Security policies are correctly set up in PostgreSQL through Supabase to avoid unauthorized data access.
4. **Deployment Failures on Render.com**:
   - Check build logs on Render.com for specific error messages. Ensure environment variables are correctly set up according to your project requirements.

By understanding each component's role within MorningAI's system architecture, developers can navigate the platform more effectively, contributing to or extending its capabilities as needed.
