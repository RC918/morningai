# System Architecture of MorningAI

MorningAI leverages a modern, scalable, and robust system architecture designed to provide a seamless experience in autonomous code generation, documentation management, and real-time task orchestration. This document outlines the key components of the MorningAI platform, providing developers with the necessary information to understand and interact with the system effectively.

## Overview

The MorningAI platform is built on a microservices architecture, utilizing a combination of technologies for frontend development, backend services, database management, task queueing, workflow orchestration, AI-powered content generation, and deployment. Below is a detailed breakdown of each component within the MorningAI system architecture:

### Frontend

- **Technology Stack**: React with Vite for bundling and TailwindCSS for styling.
- **Path**: The frontend code resides in the `frontend/` directory.
- **Key Features**: Provides a responsive and interactive user interface for accessing MorningAI's features.

```jsx
// Example: App.jsx
import React from 'react';
import './App.css';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <header className="App-header">
        Welcome to MorningAI
      </header>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

### Backend

- **Technology Stack**: Python with Flask framework and Gunicorn as the WSGI HTTP server.
- **Path**: Backend services are found under `backend/`.
- **Key Features**: Handles API requests, integrates with AI models for content generation, manages database operations.

```python
# Example: app.py
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello from Flask!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

### Database

- **Technology Stack**: PostgreSQL with Supabase for real-time subscriptions and Row Level Security (RLS).
- **Path**: Database schemas and migrations are located in `database/`.
- **Key Features**: Stores user data, generated content, and system logs securely.

### Queue

- **Technology Stack**: Redis Queue (RQ) for managing background tasks.
- **Path**: Task definitions and queue configurations are in `queue/`.
- **Key Features**: Facilitates asynchronous task processing to improve system performance.

### Orchestration

- **Technology Stack**: LangGraph is used for defining agent workflows.
- **Path**: Workflow configurations can be found in `orchestration/`.
- **Key Features**: Manages complex task flows between different services and agents.

### AI

- **Technology Stack**: OpenAI GPT-4 for generating content.
- **Integration Point**: Integrated within backend services for processing requests.
- **Key Features**: Powers the autonomous code generation and FAQ content creation.

### Deployment

- **Platform**: Render.com with Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD).
- **Path**: Configuration files are located in `.render/`.
- **Key Features**: Ensures smooth deployment processes and automatic updates to the platform.

## Troubleshooting Tips

1. For frontend issues related to React or TailwindCSS:
   - Ensure all dependencies are correctly installed via `npm install`.
   - Verify that the environment variables are properly set up.

2. Backend service not responding:
   - Check if Gunicorn is running with sufficient workers.
   - Review Flask logs for any uncaught exceptions or errors.

3. Database connectivity issues:
   - Verify Supabase service roles and permissions.
   - Ensure network policies allow connections from your application servers.

4. Task queue delays or failures:
   - Monitor Redis Queue dashboard for failed jobs.
   - Increase worker count or investigate memory/CPU constraints on workers.

5. Deployment or CI/CD problems:
   - Review build logs on Render.com for specific error messages.
   - Check `.render/render.yaml` file for configuration accuracy.

By understanding these key aspects of MorningAI's system architecture, developers can better navigate the platform, integrate their own services, or contribute to its development.
