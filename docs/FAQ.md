# Test Retry Success in MorningAI

## Overview

In MorningAI, ensuring the reliability and robustness of your automated tasks is crucial. One of the mechanisms provided to enhance reliability is the ability to retry tests upon failure. This feature is particularly useful when dealing with operations that may fail due to transient issues such as network latency, temporary service downtime, or rate limits. Implementing test retries can significantly improve the success rate of your tasks without manual intervention.

## How Test Retries Work

Test retries in MorningAI are managed through a combination of Redis Queue (RQ) configurations and custom logic within your task definitions. When a task fails, the system can automatically re-queue it for another attempt based on predefined criteria such as the number of retries and delay between attempts.

### Setting Up Test Retries

To configure test retries, you need to adjust the settings within your task queue setup in `app/queue.py` and implement retry logic in your task definitions.

#### Configuring RQ for Retries

First, ensure that your RQ worker is configured to support retries. You can specify the default number of retries and delay intervals in your RQ worker setup:

```python
from rq import Queue
from redis import Redis
import datetime

redis_conn = Redis()
q = Queue(connection=redis_conn, default_retry={
    'max': 3,  # Maximum number of retries
    'interval': [10, 30, 60],  # Seconds to wait before each retry: 1st retry after 10s, 2nd after 30s, etc.
})

def my_task():
    # Your task implementation here
    pass

job = q.enqueue(my_task)
```

### Implementing Retry Logic in Tasks

Within your task definition, implement logic to handle failures and trigger a retry. Here's an example using a simple try-except block:

```python
def my_task_with_retry():
    try:
        # Attempt some operation that might fail
        potentially_failing_operation()
    except Exception as e:
        raise self.retry(exc=e)  # Use self.retry() for Flask tasks with built-in retry support or customize as needed
```

Note: Ensure you have error handling that differentiates between retryable errors and critical failures that should not trigger a retry.

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

- **Retry Limit Reached**: If tasks consistently fail even after retries, investigate the root cause by logging error messages and examining stack traces.
- **Resource Exhaustion**: Be cautious with retry intervals and backoff strategies to prevent overwhelming your system or external services.
- **Improper Error Handling**: Ensure that only transient errors trigger retries. Permanent errors should be handled differently to avoid unnecessary retry attempts.

By carefully implementing and configuring test retries, you can improve the resilience and reliability of your MorningAI tasks against transient failures.
