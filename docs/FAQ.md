# MorningAI System Architecture

MorningAI is designed as a robust, scalable multi-tenant SaaS platform that leverages modern technologies to provide an autonomous agent system for code generation, FAQ generation, documentation management, and multi-platform integration. Below is an in-depth overview of its system architecture.

## Overview

The architecture of MorningAI is modular and distributed, enabling efficient handling of various tasks ranging from real-time task orchestration to vector memory storage. The key components of this architecture include:

- **Frontend**: Developed with React, utilizing Vite for build optimization and TailwindCSS for styling. This setup ensures a fast and responsive user interface.
  
- **Backend**: Built on Python using the Flask framework and Gunicorn as the WSGI HTTP Server with multi-worker support for handling concurrent requests efficiently.

- **Database**: PostgreSQL is used as the primary database, managed via Supabase which adds additional functionalities like Row Level Security for enhanced data protection.

- **Queue System**: Redis Queue (RQ) is employed for managing background tasks, allowing for asynchronous task processing. Worker heartbeat monitoring is implemented to ensure reliability.

- **Orchestration**: LangGraph orchestrates agent workflows, ensuring that autonomous agents can perform tasks efficiently and in coordination.

- **AI Integration**: OpenAI's GPT-4 powers the content generation capabilities of MorningAI, making it capable of producing high-quality code snippets, FAQs, and documentation.

- **Deployment**: The entire platform is deployed on Render.com with continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines in place to automate the software delivery process.

## Code Examples

### Flask Application Initialization

```python
from flask import Flask
from config import Config

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config.from_object(Config)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    from gunicorn.app.base import BaseApplication

    class Application(BaseApplication):
        def init(self, parser, opts, args):
            return {'bind': '0.0.0.0:8000', 'workers': 4}

        def load(self):
            return app

    Application().run()
```

This snippet shows how a Flask application is configured and ready to be served with Gunicorn with multiple workers.

### Redis Queue Setup

```python
import redis
from rq import Queue

r = redis.Redis()
q = Queue(connection=r)

def background_task():
    # Task implementation
    print("Running in the background...")

job = q.enqueue(background_task)
```

This example demonstrates setting up a Redis Queue (RQ) and enqueuing a simple background task.

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

### Database Connection Issues
Ensure that your PostgreSQL credentials are correct and that your Supabase instance is configured to allow connections from your application's IP address.

### Worker Heartbeat Monitoring Alerts
If you receive alerts related to worker heartbeats:
1. Check if all workers are running.
2. Ensure that Redis is operational.
3. Review RQ dashboard for any failed jobs that might indicate issues in task execution.

### Deployment Failures on Render.com
For deployment issues:
1. Verify your `render.yaml` file for any configuration errors.
2. Check the build logs on Render.com for specific error messages.
3. Ensure environment variables are correctly set up in Render's dashboard.
