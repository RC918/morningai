# Testing Sentry Trace ID in MorningAI

## Introduction

Sentry is an error tracking tool that helps developers monitor and fix crashes in real-time. The `trace_id` in Sentry is a unique identifier for each request or transaction, allowing developers to trace issues across distributed systems. This FAQ will guide you through the process of testing and utilizing Sentry `trace_id` within the MorningAI platform.

## Understanding Sentry Trace ID

In the context of MorningAI, Sentry's `trace_id` can be used to debug and improve the performance of your application by tracing requests from their origin through all the services they interact with. This is particularly useful in a microservices architecture where requests may span multiple services.

### How to Use Sentry Trace ID in MorningAI

1. **Integration Setup**

   Ensure Sentry is correctly integrated into your MorningAI application. In your Flask app setup (`app/__init__.py`), include:

   ```python
   import sentry_sdk
   from sentry_sdk.integrations.flask import FlaskIntegration
   
   sentry_sdk.init(
       dsn="your_sentry_dsn_here",
       integrations=[FlaskIntegration()]
   )
   ```

2. **Generating and Retrieving `trace_id`**

   For every request processed by your application, Sentry generates a `trace_id`. You can retrieve and log this ID for debugging purposes as follows:

   In your request handler, use:

   ```python
   from sentry_sdk import Hub

   def my_request_handler():
       trace_id = Hub.current.trace_id
       print(f"Handling request with trace ID: {trace_id}")
       # Your request handling logic here
   ```

3. **Passing `trace_id` Through Services**

   If your application calls other services, pass the `trace_id` with these requests to trace them across your entire system. For HTTP requests, you can add it as a custom header:

   ```python
   import requests
   
   def call_external_service(trace_id):
       headers = {"X-Trace-ID": trace_id}
       response = requests.get("http://external-service/api", headers=headers)
       # Handle the response
   ```

### Common Troubleshooting Tips

- **Missing Trace IDs**: Ensure that Sentry SDK is initialized before any request handling code runs. This initialization should happen early in your application's startup sequence.
- **Incorrect Trace IDs**: Verify that the `dsn` provided to `sentry_sdk.init()` matches exactly with what is provided in your Sentry project settings.
- **Propagation Issues**: When passing `trace_id` between services, ensure all receiving services are equipped to handle and log or use these IDs correctly.

For more detailed troubleshooting or advanced configurations, refer to the official [Sentry documentation](https://docs.sentry.io/) and ensure that all dependencies are up-to-date.
