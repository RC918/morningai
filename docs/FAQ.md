# Testing Sentry `trace_id` in MorningAI

## What is Sentry `trace_id`?

In the context of MorningAI, Sentry is utilized for real-time error tracking and monitoring, which helps in identifying, diagnosing, and fixing issues efficiently. The `trace_id` is a unique identifier for tracing errors and performance issues across the system. It enables developers to track a single transaction or error through all the logs and systems it touches, providing a cohesive view of what happened during an incident.

## How to Test Sentry `trace_id`?

Testing the Sentry `trace_id` involves generating an error or a trace in a controlled environment and then locating that specific error or trace using its unique `trace_id` within the Sentry dashboard.

### Step 1: Configuration

Ensure Sentry is properly configured in your MorningAI application. This typically involves setting up your Sentry DSN (Data Source Name) in your application's configuration files.

For Flask applications within MorningAI (`/backend` directory), you would usually set up Sentry like this:

```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.flask import FlaskIntegration

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="your_sentry_dsn_here",
    integrations=[FlaskIntegration()],
    traces_sample_rate=1.0 # Adjust sample rate as needed
)
```

### Step 2: Generating an Error or Trace

To test the `trace_id`, deliberately generate an error or a trace. For example, you can add a route that triggers an error:

```python
@app.route('/trigger-error')
def trigger_error():
    division_by_zero = 1 / 0  # This will cause a ZeroDivisionError
    return "This won't be executed due to the error above."
```

### Step 3: Locating the Error in Sentry

After triggering the error:
1. Go to your project's dashboard on the Sentry website.
2. Locate the error event you just generated; it should appear shortly after the error occurs.
3. Click on the event to view its details, including the `trace_id`.

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

- **Error not appearing in Sentry:** Check if your DSN is correctly configured and ensure your network allows communication with Sentry's servers.
- **`trace_id` not visible:** Ensure that your sample rate for traces is correctly set (not too low), as a very low sample rate might prevent some traces from being sent to Sentry.
- **Performance issues after integrating Sentry:** Adjust your sampling rate if you notice performance degradation. A high traces sample rate can increase overhead.

Remember to replace `"your_sentry_dsn_here"` with your actual DSN from Sentry and adjust the `traces_sample_rate` as needed based on your application's requirements and traffic.
