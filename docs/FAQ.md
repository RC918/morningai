# MorningAI System Architecture

MorningAI is designed as a scalable, multi-tenant Software as a Service (SaaS) platform with an emphasis on automation, real-time processing, and seamless integration across various messaging platforms. The architecture is built to support the rapid development and deployment of autonomous agent systems for code generation, FAQ generation, documentation management, and more. Below is an in-depth look at MorningAI's system architecture.

## Core Components

### Frontend
- **Technology Stack**: React with Vite for bundling and TailwindCSS for styling.
- **Path**: The frontend codebase can be found under `/frontend` in the repository.
- **Key Features**: Implements a responsive UI that interacts with the backend through RESTful APIs or WebSocket connections.

### Backend
- **Technology Stack**: Python with Flask framework and Gunicorn as the WSGI HTTP Server.
- **Path**: Backend services are located under `/backend` in the repository.
- **Key Features**: Handles API requests, integrates with AI modules like OpenAI GPT-4 for content generation, manages database interactions, and orchestrates task queues.

### Database
- **Technology**: PostgreSQL hosted on Supabase which also provides row-level security (RLS) features.
- **Integration**: Utilizes pgvector for vector memory storage capabilities, enhancing search functionalities within the platform.
- **Security**: Configurations for RLS are specified in Supabase settings to ensure data isolation across tenants.

### Queue System
- **Technology**: Redis Queue (RQ) is used for managing background tasks and real-time task orchestration.
- **Setup**: Workers are deployed alongside the application server(s), monitoring queues and executing tasks asynchronously.
- **Monitoring**: Worker heartbeat monitoring is implemented to ensure reliability and timely execution of tasks.

### Orchestration
- **Tool**: LangGraph is used for defining and managing agent workflows, enabling complex decision-making processes within autonomous agents.
- **Implementation**: Workflows are defined as directed graphs, where nodes represent tasks or decisions, and edges represent transitions based on outcomes.

### AI Integration
- **Service**: OpenAI GPT-4 powers content generation including code snippets, FAQs, and documentation text.
- **Usage**: Integrated via API calls from the backend services, utilizing specific prompts to generate content aligned with user requests.

### Deployment
- **Platform**: Render.com is used for hosting both frontend and backend components with continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines configured for automated deployments.

## Code Examples

Due to the comprehensive nature of the system architecture, providing specific code examples within this FAQ is not feasible. However, developers are encouraged to explore the repositoryâ€™s `/examples` directory for practical implementations of each component mentioned above.

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

1. **Frontend Not Updating**: Ensure Vite's hot module replacement (HMR) is properly configured. Clear your browser cache to see changes if HMR fails.
2. **Backend Service Unresponsive**: Verify that Gunicorn workers are alive and well by checking the logs. Adjust the number of workers according to load.
3. **Database Connection Issues**: Confirm that PostgreSQL credentials in Supabase settings match those used in your application configuration.
4. **Task Queues Not Processing**: Check Redis server health and worker logs for errors. Ensure that RQ workers are running and connected to Redis.
