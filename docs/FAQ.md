# MorningAI System Architecture

MorningAI employs a modern, scalable, and robust system architecture designed to offer efficient autonomous agent-based code generation, comprehensive FAQ generation, documentation management, and seamless multi-platform integration. This document provides an overview of the system architecture, aiming to assist developers in understanding and utilizing the MorningAI platform effectively.

## Overview

The architecture of MorningAI is built around a microservices design pattern, leveraging various technologies and frameworks to ensure high performance, scalability, and reliability. Below is a breakdown of the core components:

### Frontend

- **Technology Stack**: The frontend is developed using React for building user interfaces with Vite as the build tool for a fast development experience. TailwindCSS is used for styling to allow rapid UI development.
- **Path**: The frontend codebase can be found under `RC918/morningai/frontend`.

### Backend

- **Technology Stack**: The backend services are built with Python using Flask as the web framework. Gunicorn serves as the WSGI HTTP Server to handle requests with multi-worker support for scaling.
- **Database Integration**: PostgreSQL via Supabase is used for data persistence. It includes Row Level Security (RLS) for enhanced data protection.
- **Queue System**: Redis Queue (RQ) is employed for managing background tasks, with worker heartbeat monitoring to ensure task health.
- **Orchestration**: LangGraph orchestrates agent workflows, facilitating complex task automation within the platform.
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI's GPT-4 is integrated for advanced content generation tasks including autonomous code generation and FAQ content creation.
- **Path**: Backend services and configurations are located under `RC918/morningai/backend`.

### Multi-platform Integration

MorningAI supports integration with multiple messaging platforms such as Telegram, LINE, and Messenger. This allows users to interact with MorningAI's features directly from their preferred messaging app.

### Deployment

The entire infrastructure is deployed on Render.com with continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) practices in place to ensure smooth updates and maintenance.

## Code Examples

**Gunicorn Configuration Example**:

```python
# File path: RC918/morningai/backend/config/gunicorn_config.py
import multiprocessing

workers = multiprocessing.cpu_count() * 2 + 1
threads = 2
timeout = 120
```

**Flask Application Initialization**:

```python
# File path: RC918/morningai/backend/app.py
from flask import Flask
from yourapplication import config

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config.from_object(config)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()
```

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

1. **Gunicorn Worker Timeout**: If you're experiencing timeouts with Gunicorn workers under heavy load, consider increasing the timeout value in the Gunicorn configuration or scaling up the number of workers.
2. **Database Connection Issues**: Ensure that your database credentials are correct and that your IP is allowed access if using Supabase. Check the `.env` file or similar configuration files where these credentials are stored.
3. **Redis Queue Connectivity Problems**: Verify that Redis is running and accessible. Check firewall settings if running on a remote server. Ensure that RQ worker processes are initiated properly.
