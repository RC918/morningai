# Test Retry Success in MorningAI

Understanding how to implement and manage test retries is crucial for maintaining a robust testing environment in MorningAI. This FAQ provides an overview of the test retry mechanism, offering developers insights into configuring and utilizing this feature to ensure higher reliability and stability of the application.

## Overview

In software development, particularly in continuous integration (CI) workflows, tests might fail intermittently due to various reasons such as network latency, dependency issues, or temporary service unavailability. The test retry feature allows these tests to be automatically retried a specified number of times before being marked as failed. This approach helps in mitigating false negatives in CI pipelines, ensuring that only genuine failures are highlighted.

## Configuring Test Retries

MorningAI leverages pytest for Python-based testing, which supports the retry mechanism through plugins like `pytest-rerunfailures`. To configure test retries, you need to install this plugin and adjust your pytest configuration accordingly.

### Step 1: Install pytest-rerunfailures

Ensure your virtual environment is activated, then install `pytest-rerunfailures`:

```bash
pip install pytest-rerunfailures
```

### Step 2: Configure pytest.ini

Add the retry configuration to your `pytest.ini` file or equivalent configuration file in your project:

```ini
[pytest]
addopts = --reruns 3 --reruns-delay 5
```

This configuration will retry any failing test up to 3 times with a delay of 5 seconds between each attempt.

### Example Test Case

Here's a simple example of a test case that might benefit from retries:

```python
import requests

def test_external_api():
    response = requests.get("https://api.example.com/data")
    assert response.status_code == 200
```

Given the nature of external network calls, this test could intermittently fail due to temporary issues with the external API or network instability.

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

- **Tests Still Failing After Maximum Retries**: If tests continue to fail even after the maximum number of retries, it's crucial to investigate the root cause. Check logs for error messages and consider whether the failure is due to code issues rather than transient problems.
- **Long Test Suite Execution Time**: While retrying tests can mitigate false negatives, it also increases the overall execution time of your test suite. Monitor your CI pipeline durations and adjust the number of retries or delay between retries if necessary.
- **Intermittent Failures Becoming Consistent**: Sometimes, an intermittent failure that prompts the use of retries can evolve into a consistent failure due to changes in dependencies or external services. Regularly review and update tests to reflect current expectations and dependencies.

Remember, while test retries can improve CI pipeline reliability by reducing false negatives, they should not be used as a substitute for fixing underlying issues that cause tests to fail intermittently.
