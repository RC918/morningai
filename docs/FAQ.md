# MorningAI System Architecture

MorningAI's system architecture is designed to be scalable, efficient, and capable of handling a diverse range of tasks from autonomous code generation to FAQ generation, documentation management, and multi-platform integration. Below is a detailed explanation of each component of the architecture and how they interact with one another.

## Frontend

The frontend of MorningAI is built using React, leveraging Vite as the build tool for a faster development experience and TailwindCSS for styling. The choice of these technologies ensures a modern, efficient user interface that can be easily extended or modified.

### Example:
```jsx
// src/components/ExampleComponent.jsx
import React from 'react';
import 'tailwindcss/tailwind.css';

function ExampleComponent() {
  return <div className="text-xl text-blue-500">Hello, MorningAI!</div>;
}

export default ExampleComponent;
```

## Backend

The backend is powered by Python using Flask as the web framework and Gunicorn as the WSGI HTTP Server with multi-worker support for handling concurrent requests efficiently. This setup provides a robust backend capable of supporting the platform's operations.

### Example:
```python
# app.py
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello, MorningAI!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

## Database

MorningAI uses PostgreSQL for its database needs, with Supabase adding additional functionalities such as Row Level Security (RLS) to ensure data integrity and security. This combination allows for scalable, secure storage solutions.

### Example:
```sql
-- Create a table with RLS enabled
CREATE TABLE documents (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    content TEXT,
    user_id INTEGER
);
ALTER TABLE documents ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

## Queue

Redis Queue (RQ) is used for task orchestration, enabling real-time task management with worker heartbeat monitoring to ensure tasks are executed promptly. This is crucial for operations that require immediate attention or are time-sensitive.

### Example:
```python
# task.py
from redis import Redis
from rq import Queue

q = Queue(connection=Redis())

def say_hello(name):
    print(f'Hello, {name}!')

job = q.enqueue(say_hello, 'MorningAI')
```

## Orchestration

LangGraph is utilized for agent workflows, allowing complex task orchestration within the platform. It enables the autonomous agent system to perform efficiently and reliably across various operations.

## AI

OpenAI's GPT-4 powers the content generation capabilities of MorningAI, from code generation to FAQ and documentation management. This ensures high-quality, contextually relevant output across all features of the platform.

## Deployment

The entire platform is deployed on Render.com, benefiting from its CI/CD features for seamless updates and maintenance. This choice allows for easy scaling and ensures that the platform remains up-to-date with minimal downtime.

## Troubleshooting Tips

- **Frontend Issues**: Ensure all dependencies are correctly installed via `npm install` or `yarn install`. Check console logs in the developer tools for specific errors.
- **Backend Connectivity**: Verify that Flask is running and accessible. For connection issues with Gunicorn, check if the number of workers specified matches your system's capability.
- **Database Access**: Ensure that your PostgreSQL credentials are correct and that RLS policies do not unintentionally block access to data.
- **Task Queue Delays**: Check Redis server health and worker logs for errors. Ensure that RQ workers are running and have a stable connection to Redis.
- **Deployment Failures**: Review build logs on Render.com for specific errors. Ensure all environment variables are correctly set up according to Render's documentation.
