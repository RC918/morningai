# MorningAI System Architecture

MorningAI's system architecture is designed to support a scalable, efficient, and robust service for autonomous agent code generation, FAQ generation, documentation management, and multi-platform integration. At its core, the platform utilizes a modern tech stack that includes React, Vite, TailwindCSS for the frontend, Python with Flask and Gunicorn for the backend, PostgreSQL (Supabase) for the database, Redis Queue (RQ) for task queuing, LangGraph for orchestration, OpenAI GPT-4 for AI-driven content generation, and is deployed on Render.com with CI/CD practices.

## Overview

The architecture of MorningAI is built to handle real-time task orchestration with Redis Queue (RQ), vector memory storage using pgvector/Supabase, and seamless multi-tenant SaaS operations. It emphasizes efficiency in code execution, security with Row Level Security in PostgreSQL, and scalability across multiple platforms including Telegram, LINE, Messenger.

### Frontend

The frontend is developed using React along with Vite as the build tool and TailwindCSS for styling. This combination allows for a fast development experience with hot module replacement (HMR) and a utility-first CSS framework that enables responsive design.

- **React**: Handles the UI components.
- **Vite**: Offers an optimized build tool with out-of-the-box features.
- **TailwindCSS**: Provides utility classes for styling.

```javascript
// Sample React component with TailwindCSS
import React from 'react';

const HelloWorld = () => {
  return <div className="text-center p-4 m-4 bg-blue-500 text-white">Hello World</div>;
};

export default HelloWorld;
```

### Backend

The backend uses Python with Flask as the web framework and Gunicorn as the WSGI HTTP server. This setup supports multi-worker configurations which enhance the platform's ability to handle multiple requests concurrently.

- **Flask**: A lightweight WSGI web application framework.
- **Gunicorn**: A Python WSGI HTTP Server for UNIX.
- **Python**: The primary programming language.

```python
# Sample Flask app
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello, World!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

### Database

MorningAI uses PostgreSQL managed by Supabase which adds powerful features like Row Level Security (RLS) ensuring data isolation and security across tenants.

```sql
-- Example PostgreSQL query with RLS
CREATE TABLE documents (
    doc_id serial PRIMARY KEY,
    content text NOT NULL,
    tenant_id uuid NOT NULL
);
ALTER TABLE documents ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

### Queue System

Redis Queue (RQ) is utilized for real-time task orchestration. It allows tasks to be processed asynchronously outside of the web request/response cycle.

```python
# Enqueuing a job in Redis Queue
from redis import Redis
from rq import Queue

redis_conn = Redis()
q = Queue(connection=redis_conn)

result = q.enqueue('my_function', arg1, arg2)
```

### AI Content Generation

OpenAI's GPT-4 powers MorningAI's content generation features. Integration with GPT-4 enables sophisticated AI-driven document and FAQ generation.

### Deployment

Deployment is handled through Render.com with continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD), ensuring seamless updates to the platform.

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

### Database Connection Issues

Ensure that your environment variables are correctly set up for connecting to Supabase/PostgreSQL. Check if your Supabase project keys and URLs are accurate.

### Task Queuing Failures

If tasks fail to enqueue or process:
1. Verify that your Redis server is running and accessible.
2. Check the logs for any error messages related to Redis Queue (RQ).
3. Ensure workers are running correctly by inspecting their heartbeat in your monitoring setup.
