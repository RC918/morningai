# MorningAI System Architecture

The MorningAI platform is designed to provide a robust and scalable solution for autonomous code generation, documentation management, multi-platform integration, real-time task orchestration, and vector memory storage. The architecture is built using modern technologies and frameworks to ensure high performance, reliability, and ease of use. Below is a comprehensive overview of the MorningAI system architecture.

## Core Components

### Frontend
- **Technologies**: React, Vite, TailwindCSS
- **Description**: The user interface is built with React for its reusable components and Vite for fast development and optimized builds. TailwindCSS is used for styling with its utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid UI development.
- **Path**: `/frontend`

### Backend
- **Technologies**: Python, Flask, Gunicorn
- **Description**: The backend API is developed using Flask due to its simplicity and flexibility. Gunicorn serves as the WSGI HTTP Server to handle requests with multi-worker support for concurrent processing.
- **Path**: `/backend`

### Database
- **Technology**: PostgreSQL (Supabase) with Row Level Security (RLS)
- **Description**: Supabase adds real-time and RESTful functionalities to PostgreSQL. RLS is used to enforce security policies at the database level.
- **Setup Instructions**:
  ```sql
  -- Example of setting up RLS on a table
  CREATE TABLE your_table_name (
    ...
  );
  ALTER TABLE your_table_name ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
  ```

### Queue System
- **Technology**: Redis Queue (RQ)
- **Description**: RQ is utilized for managing background tasks and job queues. It allows the system to perform asynchronous execution of tasks such as code generation or data processing.
- **Configuration**:
  ```python
  # Example of setting up an RQ queue in Python
  from redis import Redis
  from rq import Queue
  
  redis_conn = Redis()
  q = Queue(connection=redis_conn)
  
  # To enqueue a task
  job = q.enqueue('your_module.your_function', args=(your_args,))
  ```

### Orchestration
- **Technology**: LangGraph for agent workflows
- **Description**: LangGraph orchestrates complex workflows and interactions between different autonomous agents within the system.

### AI Integration
- **Technology**: OpenAI GPT-4
- **Description**: GPT-4 from OpenAI is integrated for advanced content generation capabilities, including FAQ generation and code suggestions.

### Deployment
- **Service**: Render.com with CI/CD
- **Description**: The platform uses Render.com for hosting both frontend and backend services with continuous integration and deployment pipelines for automated updates.

## Troubleshooting Tips

1. **Frontend Issues**:
   - Ensure all node dependencies are up to date by running `npm install` or `yarn install`.
   - Check console logs in the browser for any errors.
2. **Backend Connection Errors**:
   - Verify that Gunicorn is running and configured properly.
   - Ensure environment variables are correctly set up for database connections.
3. **Database Permissions**:
   - Double-check that RLS policies are correctly applied without overly restrictive conditions.
4. **Queue System Failures**:
   - Monitor the Redis server status.
   - Review job failure logs in RQ Dashboard.

By understanding the system architecture of MorningAI, developers can more effectively navigate the project repository (`RC918/morningai`), contribute to development, troubleshoot issues, and utilize the platform's capabilities.
