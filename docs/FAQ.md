## FAQ Entries

### Q: How do I monitor my AI agent's performance?
**A:** Use the built-in monitoring dashboard to track agent execution metrics, response times, and error rates in real-time. Navigate to `/api/dashboard` to view detailed performance analytics.

### Q: What happens if my agent exceeds resource limits?
**A:** Agents running in sandboxes have configurable resource limits (CPU, memory, timeout). When limits are exceeded, the sandbox will gracefully terminate the agent and log the incident to Sentry for review.
