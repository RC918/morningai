# System Architecture of MorningAI

MorningAI leverages a modern, scalable, and flexible architecture designed to facilitate autonomous code generation, efficient FAQ generation, documentation management, and seamless multi-platform integration. Below is a comprehensive overview of the system architecture, highlighting its key components and their interactions.

## Overview

The architecture of MorningAI is built around several core technologies and services, each chosen for its performance, reliability, and ease of integration. The platform operates as a multi-tenant SaaS (Software as a Service), ensuring scalability and security for all users.

### Key Components:

- **Frontend**: Developed with React, utilizing Vite for an optimized build toolchain and TailwindCSS for styling. This setup offers a responsive and intuitive user interface.
- **Backend**: Python and Flask provide the backend framework, with Gunicorn serving as the WSGI HTTP Server with multi-worker support for handling concurrent user requests efficiently.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, augmented with Row Level Security (RLS) via Supabase, offers robust data storage and management capabilities while ensuring data isolation between tenants.
- **Queue System**: Redis Queue (RQ) is employed for task queuing to manage background jobs and real-time task orchestration effectively.
- **Orchestration**: LangGraph orchestrates agent workflows, facilitating complex task sequences and interactions within the autonomous agent system.
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI's GPT-4 powers content generation tasks, providing high-quality outputs for code generation, FAQ generation, and more.
- **Deployment & CI/CD**: Render.com is used for hosting, offering continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) capabilities to streamline updates and maintenance.

### Code Example: Setting up Gunicorn with Flask

```bash
# Install Gunicorn
pip install gunicorn

# Run Flask app with Gunicorn in a production environment
gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:8000 "app:create_app()"
```

This example demonstrates how to run a Flask application with Gunicorn specifying four worker processes (`-w 4`) listening on all network interfaces (`0.0.0.0`) at port `8000`.

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

1. **Issue**: Failure to connect to the database from Flask application.
   - **Solution**: Ensure that the database URL is correctly specified in your application's configuration files. Also, verify that Row Level Security policies do not unintentionally block connections.

2. **Issue**: Tasks are not being processed by Redis Queue.
   - **Solution**: Check that Redis workers are running and that there are no connectivity issues with the Redis server. Use `rq info` to inspect the queue status.

3. **Issue**: Deployment failures on Render.com.
   - **Solution**: Review the build logs on Render for specific error messages. Common issues include exceeding resource limits or errors in the `render.yaml` configuration file.
