# System Architecture of MorningAI

MorningAI is designed as a multi-tenant SaaS platform that leverages a modern technology stack to provide features such as autonomous agent systems for code generation, FAQ generation, documentation management, multi-platform integration, real-time task orchestration with Redis Queue, and vector memory storage with pgvector/Supabase.

## Core Components

### Frontend

- **Technology Stack**: The frontend is built using React, Vite, and TailwindCSS for a responsive and modern UI/UX.
- **Path**: `frontend/`
- **Example**:
```javascript
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import './index.css';
import App from './App';

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

### Backend

- **Technology Stack**: Python with Flask and Gunicorn for handling backend services. Flask acts as the web framework while Gunicorn is used as the HTTP server with multi-worker support.
- **Path**: `backend/`
- **Example**:
```python
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello, World!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

### Database

- **Technology Stack**: PostgreSQL via Supabase with Row Level Security (RLS) enabled for secure data access.
- **Path**: Managed through Supabase console
- **Configuration Example**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE example_table (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    data JSONB
);
ALTER TABLE example_table ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

### Queue System

- **Technology**: Redis Queue (RQ) is utilized for managing asynchronous tasks and workloads. It enables efficient real-time task orchestration.
- **Path**: `queue/`
- **Example**:
```python
from rq import Queue
from redis import Redis
from my_module import count_words_at_url

redis_conn = Redis()
q = Queue(connection=redis_conn)
result = q.enqueue(count_words_at_url, 'http://nvie.com')
```

### AI and Orchestration

- **AI Technology**: OpenAI's GPT-4 is integrated for generating content including FAQs and documentation dynamically.
- **Orchestration Tool**: LangGraph is used for agent workflows to ensure smooth operation of the autonomous agents.
- **Path**: `ai/`, `orchestration/`

### Deployment

- Deployed on Render.com with continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) practices to ensure smooth updates and maintenance.

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

### Backend Service Unresponsive

Ensure Gunicorn is correctly configured with workers. A common rule of thumb is `(2 x $num_cores) + 1`.

### Database Connectivity Issues

Verify that the PostgreSQL credentials and network policies in Supabase are correctly set up to allow connections from your application.

### Task Queues Not Processing

Check if Redis is running and accessible by your application. Ensure RQ workers are running by checking their heartbeat in the RQ dashboard.
