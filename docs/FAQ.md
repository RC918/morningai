# System Architecture of MorningAI

MorningAI is designed as a scalable, multi-tenant Software as a Service (SaaS) platform, leveraging a modern stack to provide autonomous agent-based code generation, FAQ and documentation management, and seamless multi-platform integration. The architecture is crafted to support real-time task orchestration and efficient vector memory storage for enhanced performance and reliability.

## Overview

The system architecture of MorningAI can be broadly divided into the following components:

- **Frontend**: Built with React, utilizing Vite for build optimization and TailwindCSS for styling. This setup ensures a fast, responsive user interface that can be dynamically updated without reloading the page.
  
- **Backend**: The backend logic is handled by Python using the Flask framework, with Gunicorn serving as the WSGI HTTP server. This combination allows for handling multiple requests simultaneously with ease, thanks to Gunicorn's worker process model.

- **Database**: PostgreSQL is used for data storage, enhanced by Supabase to add real-time capabilities and Row Level Security (RLS) for data protection. This setup provides a robust, scalable database solution with powerful query capabilities.

- **Queue System**: Redis Queue (RQ) is employed for managing background tasks and job queues, allowing for asynchronous task processing. Worker heartbeat monitoring is implemented to ensure reliability and fault tolerance in task execution.

- **Orchestration**: LangGraph orchestrates agent workflows, enabling complex interactions between different components and services within the MorningAI platform.

- **Artificial Intelligence**: OpenAI's GPT-4 powers content generation tasks, providing advanced natural language understanding and generation capabilities that underpin the platform's documentation and FAQ generation features.

- **Deployment**: The platform is deployed on Render.com with continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) practices in place to streamline updates and maintain high availability.

## Code Examples

While specific implementation details may vary based on project requirements, below are examples of key integrations within the MorningAI architecture:

### Flask Application Initialization

```python
from flask import Flask
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
from redis import Redis
import rq

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'postgresql://supabase_url_here'
db = SQLAlchemy(app)

queue = rq.Queue('morningai_tasks', connection=Redis(host='localhost', port=6379))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

### React Component Sample

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import axios from 'axios';

class HelloWorld extends React.Component {
  async componentDidMount() {
    const response = await axios.get('/api/hello');
    console.log(response.data.message);
  }

  render() {
    return <div>Hello World!</div>;
  }
}

export default HelloWorld;
```

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

**Issue**: Backend service not responding  
**Solution**: Ensure Gunicorn is running with the correct number of workers and threads. Check the logs for any errors related to database connectivity or syntax issues in your Flask app.

**Issue**: Frontend changes not reflecting  
**Solution**: Confirm that Vite is running in development mode for hot module replacement. If changes still don't appear, clear your browser cache or check if there's an issue with your React component state or props.

**Issue**: Database connection errors  
**Solution**: Verify your PostgreSQL/Supabase connection string in your Flask app configuration. Ensure that your database instance is running and accessible from your application's environment.

**Issue**: Task queue delays or failures  
**Solution**: Check the Redis server status and ensure it's accessible from your application. Review RQ dashboard or logs for any failed jobs and investigate error messages related to those failures.
