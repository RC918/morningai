# Test Retry Success in MorningAI

Understanding and implementing test retries can significantly enhance the reliability of the MorningAI platform's CI/CD pipeline. This FAQ is designed to help developers comprehend the mechanism behind test retries, how to configure them, and troubleshoot common issues.

## Understanding Test Retries

Test retries are a mechanism used to automatically rerun failed tests before marking them as failures. This approach can be particularly useful in a complex, multi-tenant SaaS platform like MorningAI, where tests might fail due to transient issues such as network latency, dependency load times, or temporary resource unavailability rather than actual code defects.

### Configuration

MorningAI utilizes a combination of testing frameworks and CI/CD tools that support test retries. The configuration for retries can usually be found in the specific tool's configuration file.

For instance, if you're using pytest with Flask applications:

1. **pytest.ini** or **pyproject.toml**: You can configure retry attempts and delay between retries.

```ini
# pytest.ini example
[pytest]
addopts = --reruns 3 --reruns-delay 5
```

This snippet tells pytest to rerun failed tests up to 3 times with a 5-second delay between each attempt.

2. **CI/CD Pipeline Configuration**: For GitLab CI, you can specify retry logic in `.gitlab-ci.yml`:

```yaml
test_job:
  script: pytest
  retry:
    max: 2
    when: runner_system_failure
```

This configuration retries the job up to 2 additional times if it fails due to system issues.

### Implementation in MorningAI

In the context of MorningAI's technology stack:

- The backend Python services might use `pytest` along with its rerun plugin.
- Frontend React applications could implement retries at the testing level with Jest by using `jest.retryTimes(numberOfRetries)`.
- For integration tests involving Redis Queue (RQ) or Supabase, ensure your test framework is set up to handle asynchronous operations and potential transient failures gracefully.

#### Code Example for RQ Job Retry

When working with Redis Queue within MorningAI for task orchestration, ensuring tasks are retried upon failure is crucial. Below is an example of how you could define a job with retry mechanisms:

```python
from rq import Retry
from redis_queue import queue

def example_task():
    # Task implementation here
    pass

job = queue.enqueue(example_task, retry=Retry(max=3, interval=[10, 30, 60]))
```

This code snippet demonstrates enqueuing a task with automatic retries upon failure. The task will be retried up to three times with intervals of 10 seconds, 30 seconds, and then 60 seconds between attempts.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

1. **Excessive Retries Without Success**: Ensure that the conditions causing the initial failure are transient and not persistent logical errors in the code.
2. **No Retries Happening**: Verify that your retry configurations are correctly set up in both your testing framework and CI/CD pipeline files.
3. **Impact on Test Suite Performance**: While retries can improve reliability, they also increase test suite execution time. Monitor your CI/CD pipeline's performance metrics and adjust retry settings as needed.

For more detailed information on configuring test retries specific to your development environment within MorningAI, refer to the official documentation of [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/how-to/retry.html), [Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/jest-object#jestretrytimes), or your chosen CI/CD tool.
