# Handling MorningAI During a Redis Outage

When MorningAI experiences a Redis outage, it can affect the real-time task orchestration and worker heartbeat monitoring, crucial components for the platform's autonomous agent system and multi-platform integration. This FAQ aims to guide developers through understanding the implications of a Redis outage on MorningAI and how to mitigate such scenarios.

## Understanding the Impact of a Redis Outage

Redis, used by MorningAI for queuing tasks (via Redis Queue) and storing ephemeral data, is central to orchestrating background jobs and maintaining system responsiveness. An outage can lead to:

- **Delayed task execution**: Tasks queued in Redis Queue may not be processed timely.
- **Worker unresponsiveness**: The heartbeat mechanism that monitors worker health via Redis might fail, making it difficult to track worker status.
- **Data inconsistency**: Temporary data stored in Redis might be inaccessible, affecting processes that rely on this data.

## Mitigation Strategies

### 1. Immediate Actions During an Outage

- **Switch to a backup Redis instance**: If configured, switch your application's connection string to a standby Redis server.
  ```python
  # Example configuration switch
  import os
  
  # Assuming an environment variable for the Redis URL
  os.environ["REDIS_URL"] = "redis://backup-instance:6379"
  ```

- **Pause new task submissions**: Temporarily disable features relying heavily on real-time task processing to prevent queuing tasks that won't be processed promptly.

### 2. Long-Term Solutions

- **Implementing Redis Sentinel for High Availability (HA)**: Use [Redis Sentinel](https://redis.io/topics/sentinel) for automatic failover management.
  
- **Use Redis Cluster for improved fault tolerance**: Distribute data across multiple Redis nodes to enhance availability and partition tolerance. [Redis Cluster](https://redis.io/topics/cluster-tutorial) setup can help in this regard.

### 3. Monitoring and Alerts

Ensure robust monitoring of your Redis instances using tools like Prometheus or Grafana. Set up alerts for early detection of anomalies in performance or availability.

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

**Issue**: Tasks are queued but not being processed.
**Solution**: Check if the RQ workers are up and able to connect to Redis. Restart workers if necessary.

**Issue**: Connection errors in application logs related to Redis.
**Solution**: Verify network connectivity between your application servers and the Redis instance. Check firewall rules and security group settings.

**Issue**: High latency or timeout errors when accessing Redis.
**Solution**: Review performance metrics for your Redis instance. Consider scaling up the instance or deploying additional instances if you're hitting resource limits.
