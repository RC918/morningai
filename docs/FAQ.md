# Testing Sentry `trace_id` in MorningAI

When integrating Sentry into MorningAI, it's essential to understand and effectively use the `trace_id` for tracing errors and performance issues across services. This FAQ provides a comprehensive guide on testing Sentry `trace_id` within the MorningAI platform.

## Understanding `trace_id`

The `trace_id` is a unique identifier used by Sentry to trace events and transactions across services. It connects errors and performance data, allowing developers to pinpoint issues and understand their impact on the application's health.

## How to Test `trace_id` in MorningAI

### Step 1: Configuration

Ensure Sentry is correctly set up in your MorningAI project. The setup involves adding Sentry DSN (Data Source Name) to your environment variables and configuring Sentry in your Flask application.

```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.flask import FlaskIntegration

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="your_sentry_dsn_here",
    integrations=[FlaskIntegration()],
    traces_sample_rate=1.0 # Adjust sampling rate as needed
)
```

### Step 2: Generating a Test Error or Transaction

To test the `trace_id`, generate a test error or start a transaction manually in your code. For example, to create a test error:

```python
@app.route('/debug-sentry')
def trigger_error():
    division_by_zero = 1 / 0  # This will cause a ZeroDivisionError
    return division_by_zero
```

For a transaction:

```python
from sentry_sdk import start_transaction

@app.route('/test-transaction')
def test_transaction():
    with start_transaction(op="test", name="Test Transaction"):
        # Simulate some operations here
        pass
    return "Transaction completed"
```

### Step 3: Verifying the `trace_id`

After triggering an error or transaction, go to your Sentry dashboard. Locate the event and click on it to view details. The `trace_id` can be found under the "Tags" section of the event details.

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

- **Missing Events**: If events are not appearing in Sentry, check that the DSN is correctly configured and that your network allows outgoing requests to Sentry's servers.
- **Sampling Rate**: If you're seeing too few or too many transactions, adjust the `traces_sample_rate` in your Sentry initialization settings.
- **Incorrect `trace_id`**: Ensure that any custom middleware or error handlers you've implemented do not interfere with Sentry's error capturing.
