# Testing Sentry `trace_id` in MorningAI

When integrating Sentry with MorningAI for error tracking and performance monitoring, it's essential to understand and test the `trace_id` mechanism. The `trace_id` is a unique identifier for each request or transaction, allowing developers to trace issues across the system effectively. This FAQ aims to guide you through understanding, generating, and testing the `trace_id` within the MorningAI platform.

## Understanding `trace_id`

The `trace_id` serves as a cornerstone in distributed tracing, enabling developers to follow a request's path through various services and components. In the context of MorningAI, it helps in pinpointing where failures occur or performance bottlenecks happen within autonomous agent workflows, documentation management, or multi-platform integration.

## Generating and Testing `trace_id`

To generate and test a `trace_id` in MorningAI, you typically interact with Sentry SDK integrated into the Flask backend. Here is a basic example of how to configure Sentry with Flask in MorningAI:

### Step 1: Configure Sentry SDK

In your Flask application setup (usually found in `app/__init__.py` or a similar location), initialize Sentry SDK with your DSN (Data Source Name):

```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.flask import FlaskIntegration

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="your_sentry_dsn_here",
    integrations=[FlaskIntegration()],
    traces_sample_rate=1.0 # Adjust sampling rate as needed
)
```

### Step 2: Generate and Retrieve `trace_id`

Every time an error occurs or a transaction is initiated, Sentry automatically assigns a `trace_id`. You can retrieve and log this ID for debugging purposes:

```python
from flask import Flask, request
from sentry_sdk import Hub

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/test_trace')
def test_trace():
    trace_id = Hub.current.scope.transaction.trace_id
    print(f"Trace ID: {trace_id}")  # For demonstration; use logging in production
    return "Check your logs for the Trace ID"
```

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

- **Missing `trace_id`s**: Ensure that your sampling rate (`traces_sample_rate`) is correctly configured. A value too low might result in infrequent tracing data.
- **Incorrect DSN**: Verify that your Sentry DSN is correct. An incorrect DSN will prevent errors and transactions from being reported.
- **Integration Issues**: Make sure that the Sentry SDK initialization happens early in your application startup sequence to catch all potential issues.
- **Logging Configuration**: If using custom logging, ensure it doesn’t interfere with Sentry’s logging mechanisms.

By following these guidelines, you should be able to generate, retrieve, and test `trace_id`s within the MorningAI platform effectively. Properly utilizing `trace_id`s will significantly enhance your ability to debug and optimize your application.
