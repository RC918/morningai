# MorningAI System Architecture

The MorningAI platform is designed to be a highly scalable, efficient, and robust multi-tenant SaaS offering. It combines modern technologies across its stack to provide an autonomous agent system for code generation, FAQ generation, documentation management, and more. Below is a comprehensive overview of the system architecture, highlighting key components, their interactions, and how developers can leverage this platform for their needs.

## Overview

MorningAI's architecture is built with a focus on scalability, performance, and ease of use. The system is divided into several key components:

- **Frontend**: Developed with React and styled using TailwindCSS for a responsive UI. It's bundled efficiently with Vite for faster load times.
- **Backend**: Utilizes Python with Flask as the web framework. Gunicorn serves as the WSGI HTTP Server with multi-worker support for handling concurrent requests efficiently.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL through Supabase, which adds powerful features like Row Level Security to ensure data integrity and security across tenants.
- **Queue System**: Redis Queue (RQ) manages background tasks such as long-running operations or batch jobs with worker heartbeat monitoring to ensure reliability.
- **Orchestration**: LangGraph is used for managing agent workflows, ensuring that tasks are completed in sequence or parallel as required.
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI GPT-4 drives the content generation capabilities of MorningAI, providing high-quality outputs for code generation and documentation.
- **Deployment**: Render.com hosts the platform with continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) to streamline updates and maintain system stability.

### Code Example: Initializing Gunicorn Workers

```bash
gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:8000 "app:create_app()"
```
This command starts the Flask application with 4 workers on port 8000.

### Database Configuration Example

```python
from supabase import create_client, Client

url: str = "your-supabase-url"
key: str = "your-supabase-key"
supabase: Client = create_client(url, key)
```

This snippet configures the connection to your Supabase instance.

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

### Issue: Worker Timeout Errors
If you encounter worker timeout errors with Gunicorn:
1. Check your worker configurations and adjust the timeout settings higher if necessary.
2. Ensure your background tasks are running correctly in Redis Queue without deadlocks.

### Issue: Database Connection Failures
For database connection issues:
1. Verify your Supabase URL and Key are correct.
2. Check network policies/firewall settings that may block connections between your application server and Supabase.

### Issue: Failed Deployments on Render
Ensure your `render.yaml` file has correct settings:
1. Verify build commands and environment variables.
2. Check Render's deployment logs for specific error messages that can guide troubleshooting.

By understanding MorningAI's system architecture, developers can better utilize its capabilities for building sophisticated applications that leverage AI-driven content generation efficiently.
