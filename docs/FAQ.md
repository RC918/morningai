# System Architecture of MorningAI

MorningAI leverages a modern, scalable, and robust architecture designed to provide an efficient and reliable service for autonomous code generation, FAQ documentation management, and multi-platform integration. Understanding the system architecture is crucial for developers looking to integrate with or contribute to MorningAI. This section aims to give a comprehensive overview of our system architecture.

## Overview

MorningAI's architecture is built around several core components that work together to deliver a seamless experience:

- **Frontend**: Developed using React, Vite, and TailwindCSS for a responsive and modern user interface.
- **Backend**: Powered by Python with Flask serving as the web framework, and Gunicorn as the WSGI HTTP Server with multi-worker support for handling concurrent requests.
- **Database**: Utilizes PostgreSQL for data storage, enhanced with Supabase for additional functionalities like Row Level Security (RLS), which ensures data isolation across different tenants.
- **Queue System**: Implements Redis Queue (RQ) to manage background tasks efficiently, allowing real-time task orchestration and worker heartbeat monitoring to ensure reliability.
- **Orchestration**: Uses LangGraph for managing agent workflows, ensuring tasks are executed in an orderly and optimized manner.
- **AI Engine**: Integrates OpenAI GPT-4 for generating content dynamically, including code snippets and FAQ documentation.
- **Deployment**: Hosted on Render.com with continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) practices in place to streamline updates and maintain high availability.

### Code Examples

While detailed code examples specific to each component might be too extensive for this document, here's a brief example of how a Flask application could be initialized within our backend structure:

```python
from flask import Flask
from config import Config

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config.from_object(Config)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()
```

This simple example shows the initialization of a Flask application with configurations loaded from an external `Config` class. For more specific examples related to other components like React setups or RQ usage, developers should refer to the respective directories within the repository at `RC918/morningai`.

### Common Troubleshooting Tips

**Issue:** Application does not start properly due to database connection errors.
**Solution:** Verify that the PostgreSQL database credentials are correct and that the Supabase instance is accessible. Ensure that environment variables are properly configured.

**Issue:** Tasks queued in Redis Queue are not being processed.
**Solution:** Check that RQ workers are running and monitor their heartbeat. Ensure there's no network partitioning or connectivity issues between your application servers and Redis.

**Issue:** Changes pushed do not reflect in the deployed application on Render.com.
**Solution:** Ensure that CI/CD pipelines are correctly configured in Render.com settings. Check build logs for any errors during deployment.
