# System Architecture of MorningAI

MorningAI employs a modern, scalable, and resilient architecture designed to support the rapid development and deployment of autonomous agent systems, FAQ generation, documentation management, and multi-platform integration. This section provides a comprehensive overview of MorningAI's system architecture to help developers understand and effectively use the platform.

## Overview

The architecture is built upon a microservices pattern, leveraging various technologies and platforms to ensure high availability, scalability, and performance. Below is a detailed breakdown of the key components:

### Frontend

- **Technology Stack**: The frontend is developed using React for building user interfaces, Vite as the build tool for fast development and bundling, and TailwindCSS for styling.
- **Code Example**: N/A
- **Related Documentation**: 
  - React: [https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)
  - Vite: [https://vitejs.dev/guide/](https://vitejs.dev/guide/)
  - TailwindCSS: [https://tailwindcss.com/docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs)

### Backend

- **Technology Stack**: The backend services are written in Python using Flask as the web framework and Gunicorn as the WSGI HTTP Server with multi-worker support for handling concurrent requests efficiently.
- **Code Example**:
```python
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello, World!'
```
- **Related Documentation**:
  - Flask: [https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/)
  - Gunicorn: [https://gunicorn.org/#docs](https://gunicorn.org/#docs)

### Database

- **Technology Stack**: PostgreSQL is used for data storage, with Supabase adding real-time capabilities and providing Row Level Security to ensure data integrity and security.
- **Code Example**: N/A
- **Related Documentation**:
  - PostgreSQL: [https://www.postgresql.org/docs/](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/)
  - Supabase: [https://supabase.io/docs](https://supabase.io/docs)

### Queue

- **Technology Stack**: Redis Queue (RQ) is utilized for managing background tasks and job queues, with worker heartbeat monitoring to keep track of job status.
- **Code Example**:
```python
from rq import Queue
from redis import Redis
redis_conn = Redis()
q = Queue(connection=redis_conn)

result = q.enqueue(func, args)
```
- **Related Documentation**:
  - RQ: [http://python-rq.org/docs/](http://python-rq.org/docs/)

### Orchestration & AI

- **Orchestration**: LangGraph is used for orchestrating agent workflows within the system.
- **AI**: OpenAI GPT-4 powers content generation across the platform.
- **Code Example**: N/A
- **Related Documentation**:
  - OpenAI API: [https://beta.openai.com/documentation/](https://beta.openai.com/documentation/)

### Deployment

- **Platform**: Render.com is used for hosting with continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) practices in place to streamline updates.
- **Code Example**: N/A
- **Related Documentation**:
  - Render: [https://render.com/docs](https://render.com/docs)

## Troubleshooting Tips

1. **Frontend Issues**: Ensure dependencies are up-to-date and compatible. Clear browser cache or use incognito mode to test changes.
2. **Backend Issues**: Check Gunicorn logs for error messages. Ensure environment variables are correctly set up according to your `.env` file.
3. **Database Connection Errors**: Verify that your database credentials are correct and that your IP address is whitelisted if necessary in Supabase settings.
4. **Queue Job Failures**: Monitor RQ dashboard for failed jobs. Review job failure messages to diagnose issues related to task execution or resource allocation.

By understanding MorningAI's system architecture, developers can navigate the platform more effectively, troubleshoot issues efficiently, and contribute to its development.
