# Testing Sentry Trace ID in MorningAI

This FAQ provides guidance on how to test and work with Sentry's `trace_id` within the MorningAI platform. Sentry is an application monitoring platform that helps developers identify, triage, and resolve issues. The `trace_id` is a crucial part of Sentry's tracing system, allowing developers to track the flow of requests and tasks through the application, making debugging and performance monitoring more efficient.

## Understanding Sentry `trace_id`

In the context of MorningAI, the `trace_id` is used to correlate logging information across different services and components within the platform. This ensures that developers can trace the path of a request or task across multiple systems and identify where errors or bottlenecks occur.

### Code Example: Generating and Logging `trace_id`

When integrating Sentry with MorningAI, each incoming request or task should generate a unique `trace_id`. This ID should then be logged at key points within your codebase.

```python
import sentry_sdk

# Assuming Flask app context
from flask import request

sentry_sdk.init(dsn="your_sentry_dsn_here")

def log_trace_id():
    with sentry_sdk.configure_scope() as scope:
        trace_id = request.headers.get('sentry-trace-id')
        if trace_id:
            scope.set_tag("trace_id", trace_id)
            app.logger.info(f"Processing request with trace ID: {trace_id}")
```

### Integrating with MorningAI

To integrate this functionality within the MorningAI platform, ensure that your Flask application (typically found under `/backend`) is correctly set up to generate and log `trace_id`s as shown above. This setup helps in maintaining consistent tracking across all requests handled by MorningAI's backend services.

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

1. **Missing `trace_id`s**: Ensure that Sentry is correctly initialized in your Flask application. The DSN (Data Source Name) should be properly configured.
2. **Incorrect Logging**: Verify that the logging of `trace_id` occurs at strategic points within your code to capture relevant data throughout the request or task lifecycle.
3. **Performance Issues**: Over-logging can lead to performance bottlenecks. Ensure you're only logging essential information.
4. **Sentry Configuration**: Double-check your Sentry project settings to ensure they're aligned with your current environment (development, staging, production).

Remember, effectively using `trace_id` within Sentry can significantly enhance your ability to monitor, debug, and improve the MorningAI platform's performance and reliability.
