# Handling a Redis Outage in MorningAI

When encountering a Redis outage within the MorningAI platform, it's crucial for developers to understand how to diagnose and mitigate the issue effectively. Redis Queue (RQ) plays a significant role in real-time task orchestration within MorningAI, and an outage can halt background job processing, affecting the overall functionality of the platform.

## Understanding the Impact of a Redis Outage

A Redis outage can lead to several issues within MorningAI, including but not limited to:

- Delayed or failed execution of autonomous agent tasks.
- Inability to generate or update FAQs and documentation in real-time.
- Disruption in multi-platform integration message processing.
- Failure in maintaining worker heartbeat monitoring, which can cause an inaccurate representation of worker health status.

## Steps to Diagnose and Mitigate

### 1. Verify Redis Connection

First, ensure that your application can establish a connection with Redis. You can do this by checking the connectivity logs or using a simple Python script to test the connection:

```python
import redis

try:
    r = redis.Redis(host='your_redis_host', port=6379, db=0)
    r.ping()
    print("Connected to Redis")
except redis.ConnectionError:
    print("Failed to connect to Redis")
```

Replace `your_redis_host` with your actual Redis host address.

### 2. Check for Network Issues

Verify that there are no network issues between your application servers and the Redis server. This includes checking firewalls, network ACLs, and ISP-related issues.

### 3. Monitor Redis Server Health

Using Redis monitoring tools or commands like `redis-cli info` can help you assess the health of your Redis server. Look for signs of memory pressure, slow queries, or error messages in the logs.

### 4. Review RQ Worker Status

Check the status of your RQ workers by running:

```shell
rq info --url redis://your_redis_host:6379/0
```

This command provides information about the number of workers, queues, and jobs currently being processed or in queue.

### 5. Implement Fallback Mechanisms

Consider implementing fallback mechanisms for critical tasks that cannot tolerate delays. This could involve queuing tasks in an alternative storage system temporarily or triggering alerts for manual intervention.

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

- **Issue:** "Cannot connect to Redis server."  
  **Resolution:** Verify that your Redis server is running and accessible. Check firewall rules and network connectivity.
  
- **Issue:** "Tasks are not being processed by workers."  
  **Resolution:** Ensure RQ workers are running and connected to the correct Redis instance. Restart workers if necessary.
  
- **Issue:** "High latency in task processing."  
  **Resolution:** Monitor CPU and memory usage on the Redis server. Consider scaling up resources or optimizing tasks for better performance.

Remember that proactive monitoring and having redundancy plans for your data stores are key strategies in mitigating the impact of outages like these.
