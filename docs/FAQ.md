# System Architecture of MorningAI

The MorningAI platform is designed to facilitate autonomous code generation, FAQ generation, documentation management, and multi-platform integration. Its architecture is built to support scalable, efficient, and real-time operations for a wide range of tasks. Below is a comprehensive overview of the system architecture, highlighting its core components, technology stack, and how they interact within the ecosystem.

## Core Components

### Frontend
- **Technology Stack**: React with Vite for bundling and TailwindCSS for styling.
- **Purpose**: Provides the user interface for interaction with MorningAI's features.
- **Path**: `/frontend`

### Backend
- **Technology Stack**: Python with Flask as the web framework, Gunicorn serving as the WSGI HTTP Server with multi-worker support for handling concurrent requests.
- **Purpose**: Manages API requests, task orchestration, and serves as the intermediary between the frontend and database.
- **Path**: `/backend`

### Database
- **Technology Stack**: PostgreSQL, enhanced with Row Level Security (RLS) via Supabase for user data isolation in a multi-tenant environment.
- **Purpose**: Stores all persistent data including user accounts, code generation tasks, FAQs, and documentation content.
- **Path**: `/supabase`

### Queue System
- **Technology Stack**: Redis Queue (RQ) utilized for managing background tasks with worker heartbeat monitoring to ensure reliability.
- **Purpose**: Handles asynchronous task execution such as code generation requests or batch processing for efficiency and scalability.
- **Path**: `/redis_queue`

### Orchestration
- **Technology Stack**: LangGraph is used for defining agent workflows in a versatile and scalable manner.
- **Purpose**: Coordinates complex processes between different components of the system to ensure smooth operation and task management.
- **Path**: `/orchestration`

### AI Integration
- **Technology Stack**: OpenAI GPT-4 powers the content generation including FAQs and documentation through natural language understanding and generation capabilities.
- **Purpose**: Automates content creation and provides intelligent responses to user queries.
- **Path**: `/ai`

### Deployment
- **Platform**: Render.com with continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines set up for streamlined updates and maintenance.
- **Purpose**: Hosts all parts of MorningAI ensuring availability, scalability, and security of the service.

## Code Examples

Due to the nature of this topic, direct code examples are not applicable. However, developers looking to understand specific implementations can refer to:

```plaintext
/frontend/src/App.js  // Entry point for React application
/backend/app.py       // Main Flask application setup
/supabase/migrations  // Database schema migrations
/redis_queue/tasks.py // Example task definitions for RQ
```

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

**Issue:** Frontend not updating after backend changes.  
**Solution:** Ensure that the frontend build process is triggered after backend updates. In development mode, use `vite`'s hot module replacement (HMR).

**Issue:** Tasks stuck in Redis Queue without being processed.  
**Solution:** Check that RQ workers are running and there are no network issues preventing them from accessing Redis. Monitor the worker's heartbeat logs for any anomalies.

**Issue:** Database migrations fail during deployment.  
**Solution:** Review migration scripts for errors or conflicts with existing schema. Ensure that CI/CD pipelines have appropriate credentials to execute migrations on Supabase.
