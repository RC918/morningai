# How to Use MorningAI for Code Generation

MorningAI's autonomous agent system provides a powerful tool for developers looking to streamline their code generation processes. This guide will help you understand how to leverage MorningAI's capabilities effectively, ensuring you can integrate its features into your development workflow seamlessly.

## Getting Started with Code Generation

MorningAI utilizes an advanced AI model to facilitate the creation of code based on user inputs. To begin using this feature, ensure you have access to the RC918/morningai repository and have followed the setup instructions located in the `README.md` file.

### Setting Up Your Environment

Before diving into code generation, confirm that your development environment meets the following requirements:

- Python 3.8 or higher installed
- Access to the MorningAI platform through Render.com with CI/CD configured
- PostgreSQL database connection set up via Supabase

Refer to the `setup/` directory for detailed setup instructions and environment configuration files.

### Code Generation Example

To generate code using MorningAI, use the following steps as a guideline:

1. **Prepare Your Query**: Clearly define what you need the generated code to accomplish. For example, "Create a Flask endpoint for user registration."

2. **Invoke the Autonomous Agent System**: Utilize the provided API endpoint or GUI tool within MorningAI to submit your query. 

```python
import requests

# Replace 'your_api_key_here' with your actual MorningAI API key
headers = {'Authorization': 'Bearer your_api_key_here'}
data = {'query': 'Create a Flask endpoint for user registration'}

response = requests.post('https://api.morningai.com/generate-code', headers=headers, json=data)
if response.status_code == 200:
    generated_code = response.json()['code']
    print(generated_code)
else:
    print("Error:", response.text)
```

3. **Review and Integrate Generated Code**: Evaluate the generated code snippet for accuracy and relevance before integrating it into your project.

- [Integration Guide](/docs/integration_guide.md): Instructions on how to integrate MorningAI with Telegram, LINE, Messenger, and other platforms.

### Common Troubleshooting Tips

- **Issue**: Generated code does not compile or run as expected.
  - **Solution**: Ensure that all prerequisites are met and that your query is as specific as possible. Review the generated code for any placeholders that need customization.

- **Issue**: API calls to generate code fail with authentication errors.
  - **Solution**: Verify that your API key is correct and has not expired. Check the `Authorization` header format in your request.

- **Issue**: Slow response times when generating code.
  - **Solution**: Check the status of Redis Queue (RQ) workers and ensure they are running optimally. Consider scaling up workers if necessary.
