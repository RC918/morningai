# MorningAI System Architecture

MorningAI is designed as a highly scalable, multi-tenant SaaS platform with a focus on autonomous code generation, documentation management, and seamless integration across multiple platforms. The architecture is built to support real-time task orchestration and vector memory storage, leveraging a modern stack that includes React, Python, Flask, PostgreSQL (with Supabase), Redis Queue (RQ), and OpenAI GPT-4 for AI-driven content generation.

## Core Components

### Frontend
The frontend is developed using **React** with **Vite** as the build tool and **TailwindCSS** for styling. This combination allows for fast development cycles and a responsive UI. The entry point for the React application can be found under `frontend/src/main.jsx`.

```jsx
// Sample from frontend/src/main.jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import './index.css';
import App from './App';

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

### Backend
The backend services are built with **Python** using the **Flask** framework. **Gunicorn** serves as the WSGI HTTP Server, configured for multi-worker support to enhance concurrency. API endpoints are defined within `backend/app/api`.

```python
# Sample Flask app initialization in backend/app/__init__.py
from flask import Flask
from .api import bp as api_bp

def create_app():
    app = Flask(__name__)
    app.register_blueprint(api_bp, url_prefix='/api')
    return app
```

### Database
MorningAI utilizes **PostgreSQL** for data persistence, with an extension to **Supabase** for easy scaling and additional features like Row Level Security (RLS). This setup ensures secure, multi-tenant data storage capabilities.

### Queue System
Task orchestration is handled via **Redis Queue (RQ)**, allowing for efficient real-time task processing. Worker heartbeat monitoring ensures system reliability and performance. Workers are typically defined in `backend/worker.py`.

```python
# Sample worker setup in backend/worker.py
import os
from redis import Redis
from rq import Worker, Queue, Connection

listen = ['high', 'default', 'low']

redis_url = os.getenv('REDISTOGO_URL', 'redis://localhost:6379')

conn = Redis.from_url(redis_url)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    with Connection(conn):
        worker = Worker(map(Queue, listen))
        worker.work()
```

### Orchestration and AI Integration
Task flows and AI operations are orchestrated using **LangGraph**, while AI-powered content generation is driven by **OpenAI GPT-4**. This integration facilitates autonomous agent systems capable of generating high-quality code snippets and documentation.

### Deployment
The platform is deployed on **Render.com**, utilizing its CI/CD pipelines for seamless updates and scalability. Configuration files related to deployment can be found under `.render`.

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

1. **Frontend Issues**: Ensure all node modules are correctly installed (`npm install`) and that the Vite server is running (`npm run dev`).
2. **Backend Connection Errors**: Verify that all environment variables related to database connections and external services are correctly set.
3. **Database Migrations**: Run any pending migrations (`flask db upgrade`) to ensure your database schema is up-to-date.
4. **Queue System Failures**: Check Redis server availability and worker logs for any errors or connection issues.
5. **Deployment Problems**: Consult Render.com's documentation for common deployment issues related to build configurations or environmental variables.
