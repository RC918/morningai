# Handling Redis Outage in MorningAI

In the event of a Redis outage, MorningAI's real-time task orchestration and queue management capabilities may be impacted. Redis Queue (RQ) is integral to managing background jobs that power autonomous agent systems, multi-platform integrations, and other asynchronous tasks within MorningAI. This FAQ aims to guide developers through understanding the implications of a Redis outage and how to effectively respond to ensure minimal disruption to the MorningAI platform.

## Understanding the Impact of a Redis Outage

A Redis outage can affect various parts of the MorningAI platform, including:

- Delay in execution or complete halt of background tasks queued via RQ.
- Disruption in real-time task orchestration.
- Potential loss of non-persistent data if not properly backed up.

### Code Example: Checking Redis Connection Health

To monitor and check the health of your Redis connection, you can use the following Python snippet:

```python
import redis

def check_redis_connection():
    try:
        r = redis.Redis(host='localhost', port=6379, db=0)
        r.ping()
        print("Redis connection is healthy.")
    except redis.ConnectionError:
        print("Failed to connect to Redis.")

check_redis_connection()
```

This code attempts to establish a connection with Redis and sends a ping. If successful, it confirms the health of the connection; otherwise, it catches and prints an error message.

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

**1. Verify Redis Server Status**: Ensure that the Redis server is up and running. Use `redis-cli ping` command to check if the server responds with `PONG`.

**2. Check Network Configuration**: Ensure there are no network issues blocking communication between MorningAI services and Redis.

**3. Monitor Logs for Errors**: Check both MorningAI application logs and Redis server logs for any error messages or warnings that could indicate the source of the problem.

**4. Reconnect Logic Implementation**: Ensure your application has logic to attempt reconnection or switch over to a standby Redis server in case of connectivity issues.

**5. Backup and Recovery Plan**: Regularly backup your Redis data and have a recovery plan in place to minimize data loss in case of an outage.

### Example Reconnection Logic

Here's an example snippet showing how you might implement reconnection logic with exponential backoff:

```python
import redis
from time import sleep

def reconnect_with_backoff():
    max_attempts = 5
    attempt = 0
    
    while attempt < max_attempts:
        try:
            r = redis.Redis(host='localhost', port=6379, db=0)
            r.ping()
            print("Successfully reconnected to Redis.")
            break
        except redis.ConnectionError as e:
            wait = 2 ** attempt
            print(f"Connection failed. Retrying in {wait} seconds...")
            sleep(wait)
            attempt += 1

reconnect_with_backoff()
```

By following these guidelines and implementing robust error handling and recovery procedures, developers can mitigate the impact of a Redis outage on MorningAI's operations.
