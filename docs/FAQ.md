# Test Retry Success in MorningAI

When working with MorningAI, ensuring the reliability and robustness of your autonomous agent system or any other component is crucial. Test retries are a fundamental part of achieving this, allowing your tests to automatically rerun if they fail initially. This FAQ will guide you through the process of implementing test retries within the MorningAI platform, enhancing your development workflow.

## Understanding Test Retries

Test retries are designed to handle flaky tests that might fail due to transient issues such as network instability or temporary service downtimes. By retrying a failed test, you can distinguish between flaky failures and genuine issues in your codebase.

### How Test Retries Work

In MorningAI, test retries can be configured at multiple levels including individual tests, files, or globally across all tests. The system will automatically retry a failed test based on the specified criteria and parameters.

### Configuring Test Retries

To configure test retries in MorningAI, you'll need to modify your testing configuration file. Here's an example using pytest with a Flask application in the `RC918/morningai` repository:

```python
# pytest.ini file
[pytest]
addopts = --reruns 3
```

This configuration tells pytest to rerun any failed tests up to 3 times before marking them as failures.

For more granular control, you can use decorators for specific tests:

```python
import pytest

@pytest.mark.flaky(reruns=5, reruns_delay=2)
def test_example():
    # Your flaky test code here
```

This approach allows you to specify the number of reruns and delay between retries for individual tests.

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

1. **Ensure Correct Configuration**: Double-check your `pytest.ini` or test decorator configurations to ensure they're correctly set up for retries.
2. **Monitor Flakiness**: If certain tests consistently require multiple retries, investigate the underlying causes such as dependency issues or timing problems.
3. **Resource Cleanup**: Make sure each test properly cleans up resources (e.g., database entries) even after a failure to prevent side effects on subsequent retries or other tests.
4. **Logging and Reporting**: Utilize logging within your tests to capture detailed information about each retry attempt. This data is invaluable for debugging persistent issues.

Implementing and managing test retries effectively can significantly improve the stability and reliability of your projects on MorningAI. By understanding how to configure and troubleshoot these retries, developers can ensure their autonomous agents and other components operate smoothly under various conditions.
