# Handling Redis Outage in MorningAI

In the event of a Redis outage, MorningAI's real-time task orchestration and queue management capabilities may be impacted. This FAQ provides guidance on understanding, mitigating, and resolving issues related to Redis outages within the MorningAI platform.

## Understanding the Impact of a Redis Outage

Redis Queue (RQ) is a vital component of MorningAI, facilitating task queuing and worker management for asynchronous job processing. An outage can lead to:

- Inability to enqueue new tasks
- Stalled processing of ongoing tasks
- Potential loss of task data not backed up or persisted outside Redis

### Code Example: Monitoring Redis Health

To monitor the health of your Redis instance, you can implement a simple health check endpoint in Flask:

```python
from flask import Flask, jsonify
import redis

app = Flask(__name__)
redis_url = "redis://localhost:6379"
redis_conn = redis.Redis.from_url(redis_url)

@app.route('/health/redis', methods=['GET'])
def check_redis():
    try:
        redis_conn.ping()
        return jsonify({"status": "success", "message": "Redis is up"}), 200
    except redis.ConnectionError:
        return jsonify({"status": "failure", "message": "Cannot connect to Redis"}), 503

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

This endpoint attempts to ping the Redis server and returns a success response if successful or a failure if it cannot connect.

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

In case of a Redis outage, consider the following steps for troubleshooting and mitigation:

1. **Check Redis Server Status**: Ensure that the Redis server is running. Use commands like `redis-cli ping` which should return `PONG` if the server is up.
2. **Review Logs**: Check the logs for any errors or warnings that might indicate what caused the outage or issue.
3. **Resource Utilization**: Monitor CPU and memory usage to ensure that system resources are not being maxed out, leading to performance issues or crashes.
4. **Network Issues**: Verify network connectivity between your application servers and Redis server, including firewall rules and network ACLs.
5. **Data Persistence**: If using RQ with persistent queues, ensure that your data is being correctly saved to disk so that it can be recovered after resolving any issues.
6. **Failover Strategy**: Implement a failover strategy using Redis Sentinel or a managed service like AWS ElastiCache with multi-AZ deployment for higher availability.
7. **Backup Regularly**: Regular backups can help recover from data loss in case of severe failures.

### Example: Restarting Redis Service

If you've determined that the issue is with the Redis service itself, you might need to restart it. Here's how you could do it on a Unix-like system:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart redis.service
```

After restarting, check the status to ensure it's running smoothly:

```bash
sudo systemctl status redis.service
```

Remember, handling an outage effectively requires preparation and understanding of your infrastructure and dependencies. Monitoring, regular checks, and having recovery procedures in place are key to maintaining system resilience.
