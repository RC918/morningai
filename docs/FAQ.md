# Test Retry Success in MorningAI

Ensuring the reliability and robustness of applications involves implementing mechanisms that can gracefully handle temporary failures or anomalies. In MorningAI, we have incorporated a retry mechanism that attempts to execute a failed task again before marking it as a failure. This FAQ aims to guide developers through understanding and utilizing the test retry success feature in the MorningAI platform.

## Understanding Test Retry Mechanism

The test retry mechanism in MorningAI is designed to automatically re-attempt execution of tasks that fail during their initial run. This feature is crucial for handling transient issues such as network timeouts, temporary unavailability of external services, or intermittent resource constraints.

### How It Works

The retry logic is built into the task orchestration layer, leveraging Redis Queue (RQ) capabilities along with custom logic implemented in Python. When a task fails, the system checks if it meets the criteria for a retry (e.g., type of error, number of previous attempts) and schedules it for another attempt after a configurable delay.

### Configuration

To configure the retry mechanism for your tasks, you need to adjust settings in your task definition files located at `task_definitions/`. Here's an example configuration:

```python
from rq import Retry

# Define your task with retry parameters
def my_task():
    pass  # Task implementation here

retry_params = Retry(max=3, interval=[10, 30, 60])  # Retry up to 3 times with specified intervals in seconds
```

This configuration specifies that `my_task` should be retried up to three times if it fails, with retries occurring after 10, 30, and 60 seconds respectively.

## Implementation Example

Here's a basic example showing how to implement a retryable task within the MorningAI platform:

```python
from redis_queue import RedisQueue
from rq.decorators import job
from rq import Retry

@job('default', connection=RedisQueue.connection, retry=Retry(max=3, interval=[10, 20, 30]))
def example_task():
    # Your task implementation here
    raise Exception("This is a simulated failure.")

# Enqueueing the task
example_task.delay()
```

In this example, `example_task` is defined with a decorator specifying that it belongs to the 'default' queue and should be retried according to the provided `Retry` configuration upon failure.

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

1. **Task Not Retrying**: Ensure that your tasks are correctly decorated with retry configurations and that they are enqueued properly.
2. **Incorrect Retry Intervals**: Double-check your `Retry` parameters. Ensure intervals are set according to your requirements.
3. **Max Retries Exceeded Without Success**: Investigate the root cause of failures. Consider increasing the number of retries or adjusting intervals if necessary.
