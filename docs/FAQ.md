# System Architecture of MorningAI

The MorningAI platform is designed as a multi-tenant Software as a Service (SaaS) solution, offering a suite of features including autonomous agent systems for code generation, FAQ generation, documentation management, and multi-platform integration. Its architecture is built to support real-time task orchestration and vector memory storage, ensuring high performance and scalability. Below is a detailed overview of the system architecture, relevant code examples, documentation links, and troubleshooting tips.

## Overview

MorningAI leverages a modern tech stack and architectural principles to offer efficient, scalable services:

- **Frontend**: Developed with React, utilizing Vite for build optimization and TailwindCSS for styling. This choice ensures a fast, responsive user interface adaptable to multiple devices.
  
- **Backend**: The server-side logic is handled by Python with Flask, utilizing Gunicorn as the WSGI HTTP Server with multi-worker support for handling concurrent requests efficiently.
  
- **Database**: PostgreSQL is used for data persistence, with Supabase adding additional features like Row Level Security (RLS) for enhanced data protection and pgvector for vector memory storage capabilities.
  
- **Queue System**: Redis Queue (RQ) is used for task queue management, enabling asynchronous task processing to keep the application responsive. Worker heartbeat monitoring ensures that tasks are processed reliably.
  
- **Orchestration**: LangGraph manages agent workflows within the platform, coordinating between different services and tasks in real-time.

- **AI Integration**: OpenAI's GPT-4 powers content generation features such as FAQ generation and code suggestions, providing accurate and contextually relevant outputs.

- **Deployment**: The platform is hosted on Render.com, benefiting from its CI/CD pipelines for streamlined updates and maintenance.

## Code Examples

### Flask Application Initialization

```python
from flask import Flask
from werkzeug.middleware.proxy_fix import ProxyFix

app = Flask(__name__)
app.wsgi_app = ProxyFix(app.wsgi_app)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()
```

### Redis Queue Setup

```python
import redis
from rq import Queue

r = redis.Redis()
q = Queue(connection=r)

def background_task():
    # Task implementation
    pass

job = q.enqueue(background_task)
```

## Troubleshooting Tips

### Database Connection Issues
Ensure that your database URL in the environment variables matches your Supabase instance's credentials. Double-check the use of Row Level Security if you're encountering permission errors.

### Task Queue Delays
If tasks in Redis Queue are taking too long or not being processed:
1. Verify that RQ workers are running (`rq worker` command).
2. Check for any uncaught exceptions in task functions.
3. Ensure Redis server availability.

### Deployment Failures on Render.com
Make sure your `render.yaml` file correctly specifies the build and deploy commands according to the Render.com documentation. Log files can provide insights into any errors during the deployment process.

For further assistance, refer to specific component documentation or consult community forums related to the technology stack.
