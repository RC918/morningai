# Test Retry Mechanism in MorningAI

MorningAI implements a robust test retry mechanism to ensure the reliability and stability of code before it's deployed. This FAQ is designed to help developers understand and utilize this feature within the MorningAI platform effectively.

## Understanding the Test Retry Mechanism

The test retry mechanism in MorningAI is designed to automatically rerun failed tests a configurable number of times before marking them as failures. This approach helps mitigate issues caused by transient conditions such as network latency, temporary service outages, or flaky tests.

### How It Works

When a test fails during the CI/CD pipeline execution, the retry mechanism kicks in based on the rules defined in the configuration file. If the test passes on any subsequent attempt, it is marked as passed for the pipeline execution, reducing the likelihood of false negatives impacting development workflows.

### Configuration

To configure test retries in MorningAI, navigate to your project settings within the repository at `RC918/morningai`. In the CI/CD configuration file (commonly `.gitlab-ci.yml` or `.github/workflows/ci.yml`), you can specify the retry policy.

Example configuration snippet for a GitLab CI pipeline:

```yaml
test_job:
  script: pytest
  retry:
    max: 2
    when:
      - runner_system_failure
      - unknown_failure
```

This configuration will retry any test job up to two additional times if it fails due to system failures or unknown errors.

### Code Example for Implementing Retries in Tests Directly

If using pytest, you can leverage the `pytest-rerunfailures` plugin to add retries directly in your tests:

```bash
pip install pytest-rerunfailures
```

Then, modify your pytest command as follows:

```bash
pytest --reruns 3
```

This will rerun any failed tests up to three times.

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

- **Ensure Consistent Environment**: Flakiness can often be reduced by ensuring that tests run in a consistent environment. Use Docker containers or similar technologies to standardize test environments.
- **Review Test Logs**: Always review logs from failed tests before and after retries. This can provide insights into whether an issue is truly transient or indicative of a deeper problem.
- **Adjust Retry Count Carefully**: While retries can help with flakiness, too many retries might mask real issues. Start with a low number of retries and adjust based on observed behavior.
- **Isolate Flaky Tests**: If certain tests are consistently flaky, consider isolating them from your main test suite until they can be stabilized.

By understanding and properly configuring the test retry mechanism in MorningAI, developers can significantly improve their development workflow and reduce interruptions caused by transient test failures.
