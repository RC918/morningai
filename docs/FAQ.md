# MorningAI E2E Testing FAQ

End-to-End (E2E) testing is a crucial component of the development process for MorningAI, ensuring that our multi-tenant SaaS platform operates efficiently and as expected from start to finish. This FAQ aims to guide developers through our E2E testing practices, providing insights into how tests are structured, executed, and how to troubleshoot common issues.

## What is E2E Testing in MorningAI?

E2E testing involves simulating real-user scenarios to validate the system under test and its components for integration and data integrity. In MorningAI, E2E tests cover the entire application flow, from autonomous agent system operations to multi-platform integration, ensuring that all parts of the system work together seamlessly.

## How are E2E Tests Implemented in MorningAI?

MorningAI utilizes a combination of technologies for E2E testing, primarily focusing on Cypress and Selenium for web-based interactions and PyTest for backend services. Tests are designed to mimic user interactions with the system, validating both the UI/UX aspects on platforms like Telegram, LINE, Messenger, and backend processes such as task orchestration with Redis Queue.

### Code Example: PyTest Backend Test

```python
import pytest
from app import create_app
from db import db

@pytest.fixture
def app():
    app = create_app('testing')
    with app.app_context():
        db.create_all()
    yield app
    with app.app_context():
        db.session.remove()
        db.drop_all()

def test_task_orchestration(app):
    # Example test for task orchestration
    client = app.test_client()
    response = client.post('/orchestrate', json={'task': 'example_task'})
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.json['status'] == 'success'
```

## Running E2E Tests

Before running any tests, ensure your environment is correctly set up. For frontend testing using Cypress:

1. Navigate to your project directory.
2. Install Cypress via npm if not already installed: `npm install cypress`.
3. Run Cypress with `npx cypress open` for UI mode or `npx cypress run` for headless mode.

For backend tests:

1. Ensure Python dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Run PyTest in the terminal: `pytest`.

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

**Issue**: Tests fail due to environment misconfiguration.
**Solution**: Verify your `.env` or configuration files for accuracy against the documentation.

**Issue**: Selenium WebDriver errors.
**Solution**: Ensure WebDriver versions match your browser version. Update or downgrade WebDriver as necessary.

**Issue**: Timeout errors during asynchronous task testing.
**Solution**: Increase timeout settings in your test configurations or ensure background services like Redis Queue are running properly.

**Issue**: Database state affecting tests.
**Solution**: Use database transactions or fixtures to reset database state before each test. PyTest's fixture mechanism can be particularly useful here.
