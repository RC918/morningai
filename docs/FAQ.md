# Testing Sentry `trace_id` in MorningAI

In MorningAI, integrating and verifying Sentry's `trace_id` functionality is crucial for monitoring and debugging the application effectively. This FAQ aims to guide developers through the process of testing the `trace_id` within the MorningAI platform, ensuring that error tracking and performance monitoring are set up correctly.

## Understanding `trace_id`

The `trace_id` in Sentry is a unique identifier for each request or transaction. It allows developers to trace the journey of a request through various services and components of an application, making it easier to pinpoint where errors occur or performance bottlenecks arise.

## How to Test `trace_id` in MorningAI

To test the `trace_id` functionality in MorningAI, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Integration Setup

Ensure Sentry is correctly integrated into your MorningAI application. This involves setting up Sentry SDK with your project's DSN (Data Source Name) in the appropriate initialization files within your project. For a Python Flask backend, this setup might look like this:

```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.flask import FlaskIntegration

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="your_sentry_dsn_here",
    integrations=[FlaskIntegration()]
)
```

Make sure this setup is included in your backend initialization, typically found in `app/__init__.py`.

### Step 2: Generating a Test Error

Trigger a test error in your application that will be reported to Sentry. This can be as simple as deliberately causing an exception in one of your route handlers:

```python
@app.route('/trigger-error')
def trigger_error():
    division_by_zero = 1 / 0  # This will cause a ZeroDivisionError
    return "This won't be executed."
```

### Step 3: Verifying `trace_id`

Once the error is triggered, check your Sentry dashboard for the reported error. Within the error details, locate the `trace_id`. Use this ID to trace related transactions and requests across services if you're running a microservices architecture or have interconnected systems.

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

- **Missing Errors**: If errors are not appearing in Sentry, double-check that the DSN is correctly configured and that there are no network issues preventing data from being sent.
- **Incorrect `trace_id` Values**: Ensure that no middleware or proxy is altering HTTP headers, as these can impact the transmission of `trace_id`.
- **Performance Issues**: While testing, if you notice significant performance degradation, review your Sentry sampling settings to ensure they're appropriately configured for your development environment.
