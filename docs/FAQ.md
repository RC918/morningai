# E2E Test FAQ for MorningAI

End-to-End (E2E) testing is a crucial part of ensuring the quality and reliability of the MorningAI platform. This FAQ aims to provide developers with a comprehensive understanding of how to implement, run, and troubleshoot E2E tests within the MorningAI ecosystem.

## What is E2E Testing?

E2E testing involves testing the entire application from start to finish, simulating real user scenarios to ensure all integrated components work together as expected. In the context of MorningAI, it ensures that all features, including autonomous agent systems, documentation management, and multi-platform integration, function correctly in real-world scenarios.

## How to Set Up E2E Tests in MorningAI?

To set up E2E tests in the `RC918/morningai` repository, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   Ensure you have the latest version of the code by cloning the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RC918/morningai.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   Navigate to your project directory and install necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd morningai
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Test Environment:**
   Set up your test environment variables in `.env.test` file. This should include configurations for database connections, API keys, and any other services required for testing.

4. **Write E2E Tests:**
   E2E tests can be written using frameworks like Cypress or Selenium. Place your test files under `tests/e2e/`. Here's a simple example using Cypress:
   ```javascript
   describe('Login Test', () => {
     it('Should login successfully', () => {
       cy.visit('/login');
       cy.get('input[name="username"]').type('testuser');
       cy.get('input[name="password"]').type('password123');
       cy.get('form').submit();
       cy.url().should('include', '/dashboard');
     });
   });
   ```

5. **Run E2E Tests:**
   Execute your tests using the testing tool's command line interface. For Cypress, it would be:
   ```bash
   npx cypress open
   ```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### 1. Tests Timing Out

If your tests are timing out, consider increasing the timeout period in your testing framework's configuration file or ensure that your test environment matches production as closely as possible to avoid performance bottlenecks.

### 2. Flaky Tests

Flaky tests often result from non-deterministic behaviors or race conditions in the application. Make sure you're waiting for elements to be fully loaded or actions to be completed before assertions.

### 3. Environment Configuration Errors

Ensure all environment variables and configurations are correctly set for the test environment. Missing or incorrect configurations can lead to failures that are hard to diagnose.

### 4. Database Seeding Issues

Problems with database seeding can affect test results. Ensure that your test database is correctly seeded before each test suite runs to maintain consistency.
