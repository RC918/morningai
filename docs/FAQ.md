# How to Use MorningAI for Code Generation

MorningAI leverages an autonomous agent system to streamline code generation, making it easier for developers to produce high-quality code swiftly. This FAQ aims to guide developers through the process of utilizing MorningAI's code generation capabilities, ensuring an efficient and productive development experience.

## Understanding MorningAI's Autonomous Agent System

MorningAI's autonomous agent system is designed to facilitate automatic code generation based on user inputs or predefined templates. This system employs advanced AI algorithms, including OpenAI's GPT-4, to understand the context and requirements of the task at hand, generating code that is both efficient and tailored to your needs.

### Key Features:

- **Autonomous Code Generation**: Generate code snippets or entire modules autonomously.
- **Customization and Templates**: Utilize built-in templates or create custom ones for repeated use.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Supports various programming languages, enhancing versatility.
- **Integration with Development Environments**: Easily integrates with popular IDEs and code repositories.

## Getting Started with Code Generation

To start using MorningAI for code generation, follow these steps:

1. **Set Up Your MorningAI Account**:
   - Ensure you have access to the `RC918/morningai` repository.
   - Navigate to the `docs/FAQ.md` section for detailed setup instructions.

2. **Install Required Dependencies**:
   Ensure your development environment has React, Python, Flask, and other dependencies listed in the technology stack installed. For installation commands, refer to the `README.md` file in the repository root.

3. **Initialize MorningAI**:
   - In your project directory, import MorningAI's autonomous agent module.
   ```python
   from morningai.agent import AutonomousAgent
   ```

4. **Configure Your Agent**:
   - Set up your agent with necessary parameters, including language preference and output format.
   ```python
   agent = AutonomousAgent(language='Python', template='web_app')
   ```

5. **Generate Code**:
   - Invoke the `generate_code` method with your specifications.
   ```python
   generated_code = agent.generate_code(requirements='Create a REST API for a bookstore')
   print(generated_code)
   ```
