# Test Retry Success in MorningAI

Understanding and implementing test retries is crucial for maintaining a robust and reliable codebase in MorningAI. This feature helps to identify flaky tests that might fail sporadically due to external dependencies, network issues, or timing problems. Implementing retries can significantly enhance the stability of your continuous integration pipeline by reducing false negatives.

## Overview

Test retries are designed to automatically rerun failed tests before marking them as failures. This approach helps differentiate between genuinely broken code and transient issues. MorningAI leverages this strategy across its testing suite to ensure reliability and efficiency.

### Configuration

To configure test retries in MorningAI, you'll need to adjust your test framework's settings. Below is an example using PyTest, a popular testing framework used in MorningAI's backend development:

#### PyTest Configuration

1. **Install PyTest-Retry Plugin:**

   First, ensure the `pytest-retry` plugin is installed in your environment.

   ```bash
   pip install pytest-retry
   ```

2. **Configure Retries in pytest.ini:**

   In your `pytest.ini` file, located at the root of the repository (`RC918/morningai/pytest.ini`), add the following configuration:

   ```ini
   [pytest]
   addopts = --reruns 3
   ```

   This option will retry any failed test up to 3 times before marking it as a failure.

### Usage Example

With retries configured, you don't need to alter your test cases. However, it's beneficial to be aware of how retries might affect test assumptions or setup/teardown procedures. Consider isolating tests that are not idempotent or have side effects.

```python
def test_example():
    """Example test that might fail intermittently."""
    assert intermittent_function() == expected_result
```

In this case, if `intermittent_function()` fails due to a temporary issue (e.g., network latency), PyTest will automatically retry the test up to three times based on the configuration.

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

- **Tests Still Failing After Retries:** Ensure that the failures are not due to persistent issues with the code or environment. Analyze logs and outputs carefully.
- **Side Effects Between Retries:** If your tests have side effects (e.g., altering a database), ensure proper setup and teardown logic is implemented to reset state between retries.
- **Performance Impacts:** Be mindful of the increased execution time due to retries, especially if many tests are failing intermittently.
- **Dependency on External Services:** For tests relying on external services, consider mocking these services or increasing timeout thresholds as part of your retry logic.

Implementing and configuring test retries can greatly improve the resilience of your automated testing process in MorningAI. By understanding how to effectively use this feature, developers can reduce false negatives and focus on addressing genuine issues within their codebase.
