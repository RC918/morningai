## FAQ Entries

### Q: How does the auto-merge workflow function?
**A:** The auto-merge workflow automatically merges FAQ PRs that only modify `docs/FAQ.md` and have a trace-id in the title. It uses GitHub's native auto-merge feature which waits for all required CI checks to pass before merging. The workflow is triggered on `pull_request` events with types: opened, synchronize, and reopened.

### Q: What was the circular dependency issue in PR #254?
**A:** PR #254 introduced a "Wait for CI checks" step that caused the auto-merge workflow to wait for ALL checks including itself, creating an infinite deadlock. This was fixed in PR #255 by removing that step and relying on GitHub's native auto-merge mechanism which correctly excludes itself from the checks it waits for.

### Q: How can I verify the auto-merge fix is working?
**A:** Create a PR that only modifies `docs/FAQ.md` with a trace-id in the title. The auto-merge workflow should complete within 5 minutes (not 19+ minutes like the broken version). Monitor the workflow in the Actions tab to confirm it doesn't get stuck in a "waiting" state.
