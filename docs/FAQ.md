# System Architecture of MorningAI

MorningAI is designed as a scalable, multi-tenant Software as a Service (SaaS) platform aimed at enhancing productivity through autonomous code generation, efficient FAQ management, and seamless multi-platform integration. This comprehensive overview outlines the system architecture, including its technology stack, component interaction, and configuration insights.

## Technology Stack

MorningAI's technology stack is meticulously chosen to ensure robust performance, scalability, and developer productivity:

- **Frontend**: Developed with React for dynamic user interfaces, utilizing Vite for efficient build tooling and TailwindCSS for styling.
- **Backend**: Python with Flask serves as the backbone for the API layer, with Gunicorn deploying Flask applications across multiple workers.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL through Supabase offers a relational database with advanced features like Row Level Security for data integrity and privacy.
- **Queue Management**: Redis Queue (RQ) manages background tasks with worker heartbeat monitoring to ensure reliability in task execution.
- **Orchestration**: LangGraph orchestrates agent workflows, facilitating complex task management and execution.
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI's GPT-4 powers content generation, offering cutting-edge AI capabilities for generating documentation and code.
- **Deployment**: Render.com provides deployment services with integrated Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) to streamline updates.

## Component Interaction

The architecture is designed to support high concurrency and real-time data processing. Here's an overview of how components interact within the MorningAI platform:

1. **User Requests**: Users interact with the React-based frontend, which communicates with the backend via RESTful APIs or WebSocket connections for real-time features.
2. **API Layer**: Flask routes handle incoming requests, performing operations such as user authentication, data retrieval/manipulation, and task initiation.
3. **Task Queuing**: Tasks that require asynchronous processing (e.g., code generation) are queued in Redis Queue with specific priorities and workers pick them up based on availability and priority.
4. **Data Storage**: User data, system configurations, and operation logs are stored in PostgreSQL. Supabase's features like Row Level Security ensure that multi-tenancy is handled securely.
5. **Orchestration & AI**: LangGraph orchestrates complex workflows involving multiple steps or dependencies between tasks. GPT-4 is utilized for generating human-like text responses or code snippets based on user queries or commands.

### Example: Autonomous Code Generation Flow

```python
# Flask route initiating a code generation task
@app.route('/generate-code', methods=['POST'])
def generate_code():
    data = request.json
    task = queue.enqueue('code_generator.generate', data['input'])
    return jsonify({"task_id": task.get_id()}), 202

# Asynchronous code generation function
def generate(input_text):
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="davinci-codex",
        prompt=input_text,
        temperature=0.7,
        max_tokens=150
    )
    return response.choices[0].text.strip()
```

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

1. **Worker Timeout Issues**:
   - Ensure Gunicorn is configured with an appropriate timeout setting for workers. Long-running tasks should be managed asynchronously via RQ.
2. **Database Connection Errors**:
   - Verify Supabase connection strings and credentials. Ensure that network policies allow your application server to communicate with your Supabase instance.
3. **Task Execution Delays**:
   - Check Redis Queue dashboard for queued tasks. High volume or misconfigured priorities can lead to delays. Scale workers or adjust priorities as needed.

This overview provides foundational knowledge necessary for developers to understand and effectively work within the MorningAI ecosystem.
