# System Architecture of MorningAI

The MorningAI platform leverages a robust and scalable system architecture designed to support autonomous agent systems for code generation, FAQ generation, documentation management, multi-platform integration, real-time task orchestration, and vector memory storage. This architecture is crucial for developers looking to understand how the platform operates and how to effectively utilize its features.

## Overview

MorningAI's architecture is built on a modern technology stack that ensures high performance, scalability, and ease of use. The main components of the system include:

- **Frontend:** Developed with React, Vite, and TailwindCSS for a responsive and modern user interface.
- **Backend:** Utilizes Python with Flask and Gunicorn (with multi-worker support) to handle server-side logic efficiently.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL via Supabase with Row Level Security (RLS) for secure and scalable data storage.
- **Queue System:** Redis Queue (RQ) is used for managing background jobs and worker heartbeat monitoring, ensuring task reliability.
- **Orchestration:** LangGraph manages the workflow of autonomous agents within the platform.
- **AI Integration:** OpenAI's GPT-4 powers content generation capabilities.
- **Deployment:** Render.com provides continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD), enabling fast updates and robust hosting.

### Frontend

The frontend is designed with React for its efficient update and rendering capabilities. Vite is utilized for bundling, offering a fast development environment, while TailwindCSS allows for rapid UI development with utility-first styling.

```jsx
// Example of a React component with TailwindCSS
import React from 'react';

function WelcomeBanner() {
  return <div className="bg-blue-500 text-white p-4">Welcome to MorningAI</div>;
}

export default WelcomeBanner;
```

### Backend

The backend leverages Flask as a micro web framework in Python, chosen for its simplicity and flexibility. Gunicorn serves as the WSGI HTTP Server to manage multiple workers, enhancing the platform's ability to handle concurrent requests.

```python
# Example Flask application setup
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello, World!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

### Database

PostgreSQL is used for data storage, enhanced with Supabase adding real-time capabilities and row-level security (RLS) for data protection. 

```sql
-- Example SQL query with RLS in PostgreSQL
CREATE POLICY user_view_policy ON public.users
    FOR SELECT USING (true);
```

### Queue System

Redis Queue (RQ) manages background tasks. It's configured to handle task queues efficiently, allowing the platform to perform various operations asynchronously.

```python
# Example of enqueuing a job with RQ
from redis import Redis
from rq import Queue

q = Queue(connection=Redis())

def say_hello():
    print("Hello from RQ!")

job = q.enqueue(say_hello)
```

### Deployment

Render.com is used for deploying both frontend and backend components. Its CI/CD pipeline ensures that updates are smoothly rolled out without downtime.

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

1. **Frontend not updating**: Ensure that your build pipeline on Render.com successfully completes. Check for any errors in the build logs.
2. **Database connection issues**: Verify that your Supabase credentials are correct and that your IP address isn’t blocked by any firewall rules.
3. **Background tasks not executing**: Check if Redis Queue workers are running. Ensure that there are no connectivity issues with your Redis instance.
4. **API requests failing**: Confirm that your Flask application is correctly configured to handle requests and that Gunicorn workers are not overloaded.

By understanding MorningAI’s system architecture, developers can more effectively navigate the platform’s capabilities and integrate their workflows seamlessly into the provided infrastructure.
