# Test Retry Success in MorningAI

Ensuring the reliability and robustness of your application is paramount, and one way to achieve this within the MorningAI platform is through implementing test retries. This feature allows your tests to rerun automatically if they fail, which can be particularly useful for addressing flaky tests or intermittent issues without manual intervention. This FAQ provides an overview of how to use test retries within the MorningAI environment, including code examples, related documentation, and troubleshooting tips.

## Understanding Test Retries

Test retries are designed to reduce the impact of transient issues that can cause tests to fail intermittently, such as network latency, dependencies on external services, or timing issues. By retrying a failed test automatically, you can increase your test suite's reliability while minimizing manual debugging for issues that are not consistently reproducible.

### How to Implement Test Retries

MorningAI leverages Python for backend development. Therefore, you can implement test retries using the `pytest` framework along with the `pytest-rerunfailures` plugin. Here is a step-by-step guide:

1. **Install pytest-rerunfailures**: If not already included in your project dependencies, add it by running:

```bash
pip install pytest-rerunfailures
```

2. **Configure Test Retries**: In your `pytest.ini`, `tox.ini`, or `pyproject.toml` file, add configuration options for `pytest-rerunfailures`.

Example `pytest.ini` configuration:

```ini
[pytest]
addopts = --reruns 3 --reruns-delay 5
```

This configuration tells pytest to rerun failed tests up to three times with a delay of five seconds between each attempt.

3. **Use in Tests**: You don't need to modify individual tests unless you want specific behavior for certain tests. The global configuration will apply retries automatically to all tests.

### Code Example

While specific test implementations may vary based on what is being tested, here's a basic example of how a test might look in a Flask application within MorningAI:

```python
def test_example_route(client):
    response = client.get("/example")
    assert response.status_code == 200
```

With the retry mechanism configured as above, if this test fails due to a temporary issue, it will be retried up to three times with a five-second pause between attempts.

## Troubleshooting Tips

- **Ensure Compatibility**: Make sure that the version of `pytest` and `pytest-rerunfailures` are compatible with each other.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Utilize logging within your tests to help identify why a test might be flaky or failing intermittently.
- **Isolate External Dependencies**: If possible, mock or stub external services to reduce the chances of failures due to issues outside of your control.
- **Review Test Failures**: Even if a test eventually passes after retries, review the reasons for initial failures to improve test reliability and application stability.

Remember that while test retries can help manage flaky tests, they should not replace efforts to identify and fix the underlying causes of these instabilities.
