# Test Retry Mechanism in MorningAI

Understanding and implementing a test retry mechanism is crucial for maintaining the robustness and reliability of the MorningAI platform. This FAQ aims to provide developers with comprehensive insights into how test retries can be efficiently managed within the MorningAI infrastructure.

## What is Test Retry Mechanism?

In the context of software development, a test retry mechanism refers to the process of automatically re-running tests that have failed during their first execution. This is particularly useful in continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) environments where non-deterministic tests can sometimes fail due to transient issues such as network latency, dependency unavailability, or timing issues. Implementing a retry mechanism helps in distinguishing between flaky tests and genuinely broken code.

## How to Implement Test Retry in MorningAI

MorningAI utilizes a sophisticated stack including Python, Flask, and Gunicorn among others. For illustration, we'll focus on implementing test retries within a Python-based testing framework like `pytest`.

### Step 1: Install Pytest-Retry Plugin

Ensure you have `pytest` and `pytest-retry` installed in your environment. If not, you can install them using pip:

```shell
pip install pytest pytest-retry
```

### Step 2: Configure Pytest to Use Retry

Modify your `pytest.ini` file or equivalent configuration to include retry settings. Here's an example:

```ini
[pytest]
addopts = --reruns 3
```

This configuration tells `pytest` to rerun failed tests up to three times.

### Step 3: Incorporate Retry Logic in CI/CD Pipeline

In your `.gitlab-ci.yml`, `.github/workflows`, or equivalent CI/CD configuration file, ensure your test command includes pytest with the desired flags:

```yaml
test:
  script:
    - pytest --reruns 3
```

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

- **Tests still fail after retries:** Ensure that the failures are not due to persistent issues in the codebase or dependencies. Investigate logs for consistent error patterns.
- **Retry not triggering:** Verify that `pytest-retry` is correctly installed and configured. Check if the correct command line options (`--reruns`) are being passed to pytest.
- **Performance Implications:** Be mindful of the number of retries configured as this could significantly impact CI pipeline execution time, especially for large test suites.

Implementing a retry mechanism for tests is a pragmatic approach to dealing with flaky tests and improving the stability of automated testing processes. However, it should not replace efforts to identify and fix the underlying causes of flakiness in tests.
