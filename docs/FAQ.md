# System Architecture of MorningAI

MorningAI is designed as a robust, scalable multi-tenant SaaS platform that leverages modern technologies to deliver a comprehensive suite of features including autonomous code generation, FAQ and documentation management, multi-platform integration, real-time task orchestration, and vector memory storage. This document provides an overview of the system architecture, aiming to equip developers with the knowledge necessary to understand, navigate, and contribute effectively to the MorningAI platform.

## Overview

The architecture of MorningAI is built around a microservices design pattern, enabling modular development, easy maintenance, and scalability. Key components include:

- **Frontend**: Developed with React and styled using TailwindCSS for a responsive user interface. Bundling and dev server are managed by Vite for an optimized development experience.
  
- **Backend**: The backend services are written in Python using Flask as the web framework. Gunicorn serves as the WSGI HTTP Server with multi-worker support to handle concurrent requests efficiently.
  
- **Database**: PostgreSQL is utilized for data persistence, enhanced with Row Level Security (RLS) for data access control on a per-user basis. Supabase extends PostgreSQL capabilities for additional functionalities such as authentication and real-time subscriptions.
  
- **Queue System**: Redis Queue (RQ) is employed for task queuing to manage long-running or scheduled tasks with worker heartbeat monitoring for reliability.
  
- **Orchestration**: Task orchestration and workflow management are handled by LangGraph, facilitating complex agent workflows in the autonomous agent system.
  
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI's GPT-4 powers content generation tasks within the platform, providing advanced natural language processing capabilities for code generation and FAQ content creation.
  
- **Deployment**: The platform is deployed on Render.com with continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines set up for seamless updates.

## Example: Setting Up a Development Environment

To set up your local development environment for contributing to MorningAI, follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/RC918/morningai.git

# Navigate into the project directory
cd morningai

# Install frontend dependencies
cd frontend && npm install

# Install backend dependencies
cd ../backend && pip install -r requirements.txt

# Setup environment variables
cp .env.example .env # And then edit .env with your local settings

# Start the development servers (frontend and backend)
# Frontend
npm run dev

# Backend (in a separate terminal)
flask run
```

Ensure you have Node.js, npm, Python, Flask, and Pip installed locally before running these commands.

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

**Issue**: Changes in frontend code do not reflect immediately after reload.

**Solution**: Ensure Vite's hot module replacement (HMR) is functioning correctly. Sometimes running `npm run dev` again can resolve this issue.

**Issue**: Backend service fails to start due to database connection errors.

**Solution**: Verify that PostgreSQL is running and accessible. Check `.env` file settings for accuracy against your local or remote database configuration.

**Issue**: Tasks queued in Redis Queue are not being processed.

**Solution**: Ensure RQ workers are running. You can start workers by executing `rq worker` in the terminal from your project directory. Additionally, check Redis server connectivity and worker logs for error messages.
