# Testing Sentry `trace_id` in MorningAI

Sentry is an error tracking and performance monitoring tool that is crucial for identifying, triaging, and fixing issues in production environments. In MorningAI, integrating Sentry provides valuable insights into the application's health and helps developers pinpoint problems efficiently. One essential feature of Sentry is its `trace_id`, which links errors and performance issues to specific web requests or background jobs, enabling developers to trace the origins of an issue through the system.

## Understanding `trace_id`

The `trace_id` is a unique identifier associated with each transaction (or request) that flows through your application. It allows developers to connect logs, error reports, and performance data back to the original request or job that generated them. This connection makes it easier to diagnose issues by providing a complete picture of what happened before an error occurred or performance degraded.

### How to Use `trace_id` in MorningAI

In MorningAI's Python backend, Sentry integration involves capturing `trace_id` within Flask routes or background tasks managed by Redis Queue (RQ). Below are examples demonstrating how to implement this functionality.

#### Flask Application Example

When a request hits a Flask route, you can capture the `trace_id` like so:

```python
from flask import Flask, request
from sentry_sdk import capture_message

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/example')
def example_route():
    trace_id = request.headers.get('X-Trace-ID')
    if not trace_id:
        # Generate or fetch a new trace_id if not present
        trace_id = generate_trace_id()
    capture_message('Example route accessed', extra={'trace_id': trace_id})
    return "Example response", 200

def generate_trace_id():
    # Implement your logic here to generate a unique trace_id
    return "some_unique_trace_id"
```

#### Redis Queue (RQ) Task Example

For background tasks managed by Redis Queue, you can include the `trace_id` when enqueuing the task and within the task itself:

```python
from rq import Queue
from redis import Redis
import sentry_sdk

redis_conn = Redis()
q = Queue(connection=redis_conn)

def background_task(trace_id):
    sentry_sdk.capture_message("Background task executed", extra={'trace_id': trace_id})

# When enqueuing the task
trace_id = "your_generated_trace_id"
q.enqueue(background_task, trace_id)
```

### Common Troubleshooting Tips

1. **Missing `trace_id`**: Ensure that all incoming requests have a unique `trace_id`, either provided by an upstream service or generated at the entry point of your application.
2. **Incorrectly Captured Context**: Verify that the context in which you log messages or capture errors includes the relevant `trace_id`. This might involve ensuring middleware or request handlers correctly pass this information.
3. **Visibility in Sentry**: If `trace_ids` are not visible in Sentry issues or transactions, check your Sentry project settings and ensure that your SDK initialization code is correctly configured to send this data.
4. **Performance Overhead**: Capturing extensive diagnostic data can introduce overhead. Monitor your application's performance and adjust your logging level and data capturing accordingly.
