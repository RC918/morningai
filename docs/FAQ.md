# System Architecture of MorningAI

MorningAI is designed as a robust, multi-tenant SaaS platform that leverages modern technologies to provide an autonomous agent system for code generation, FAQ generation, documentation management, multi-platform integration, real-time task orchestration with Redis Queue, and vector memory storage with pgvector/Supabase. This section aims to give developers a comprehensive understanding of MorningAI's architecture.

## Overview

The architecture of MorningAI is built to be scalable, efficient, and modular. It consists of several key components:

- **Frontend**: Developed with React, leveraging Vite for build optimization and TailwindCSS for styling.
- **Backend**: The server-side logic is handled by Python using the Flask framework and Gunicorn as the WSGI HTTP Server with multi-worker support for handling concurrent requests.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL is used for data persistence, enhanced by Supabase for added functionalities like Row Level Security (RLS) and real-time capabilities.
- **Queue System**: Redis Queue (RQ) is utilized for managing background tasks and job queues, ensuring efficient task processing.
- **Orchestration**: LangGraph orchestrates the agent workflows within the system.
- **AI Model**: OpenAI's GPT-4 powers the content generation features, including FAQ generation and code suggestions.
- **Deployment**: The application is deployed on Render.com with continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) practices.

## Code Examples

Below are snippets showcasing key parts of the MorningAI architecture:

### Flask App Initialization
```python
from flask import Flask
from werkzeug.middleware.proxy_fix import ProxyFix

app = Flask(__name__)
app.wsgi_app = ProxyFix(app.wsgi_app)
```

### Gunicorn Configuration
```shell
gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:5000 "morningai:create_app()"
```
This command starts Gunicorn with 4 worker processes.

### RQ Worker Invocation
```shell
rq worker --url redis://localhost:6379/0 morningai-tasks
```
This command starts an RQ worker listening to the `morningai-tasks` queue.

### Supabase Integration Example
```python
from supabase import create_client, Client

url: str = "your-supabase-url"
key: str = "your-supabase-anon-key"
supabase: Client = create_client(url, key)
```

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

### Database Connection Issues
Ensure your Supabase credentials are correct and that you have configured the necessary firewall rules to allow connections from your application environment.

### Worker Timeout or Overload
If workers frequently timeout or seem overloaded, consider increasing the number of workers in your Gunicorn configuration or optimizing task execution times in your RQ workers.

### CI/CD Pipeline Failures
For CI/CD issues on Render.com, verify your `render.yaml` file for any syntax errors or misconfigurations. Ensure all necessary environment variables are correctly set up in your Render dashboard.
