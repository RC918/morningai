# Test Retry Mechanism in MorningAI

Understanding and effectively utilizing the test retry mechanism in MorningAI is crucial for enhancing the reliability of your application by ensuring that transient issues do not lead to test failures. This FAQ aims to provide comprehensive insights into how the test retry mechanism works within the MorningAI platform, including configuration tips, code examples, and troubleshooting advice.

## How Test Retry Mechanism Works

MorningAI's test retry mechanism is designed to automatically rerun failed tests before marking them as failures. This feature is particularly useful for handling tests that may fail due to temporary issues such as network latency, dependent services downtime, or flaky test cases.

The mechanism can be configured at both the suite and individual test levels, providing flexibility in addressing specific needs of your testing strategy.

### Configuration

To configure test retries, you need to modify your test suite configuration files. MorningAI uses a Python-based setup, typically with testing frameworks like pytest or unittest. Here’s how you can configure it:

#### Pytest Example

If you're using pytest, you can use the `pytest-rerunfailures` plugin. First, ensure it's installed:

```shell
pip install pytest-rerunfailures
```

Then, modify your pytest configuration (`pytest.ini`, `tox.ini`, or `setup.cfg`) to include the retry count:

```ini
[pytest]
addopts = --reruns 3
```

This configuration tells pytest to rerun each failed test up to 3 times.

#### Unittest Example

For unittest, there isn't a built-in retry mechanism as in pytest. You would typically implement a retry logic in your test runner or use decorators on unstable tests. Here's a simple decorator example for retries:

```python
import unittest
from time import sleep

def retry(test_func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        max_attempts = 3
        for attempt in range(max_attempts):
            try:
                return test_func(*args, **kwargs)
            except AssertionError as e:
                print(f"Retrying {test_func.__name__}, attempt {attempt+1}/{max_attempts}")
                if attempt == max_attempts - 1:
                    raise
                sleep(1) # Optional: wait between retries
    return wrapper

class MyTestCase(unittest.TestCase):
    @retry
    def test_example(self):
        self.assertEqual(1, 2) # Example of a failing test
```

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

1. **Tests Still Failing After Retries**: If tests continue to fail even after retries, investigate if the issue is indeed transient. Look into logs and consider increasing wait times between retries if it’s related to timing issues.
2. **Incorrect Configuration**: Ensure that your retry configurations are correctly placed in your project settings. Misplaced configurations might not be recognized by the testing framework.
3. **Performance Impacts**: Be mindful of how retries might affect the total runtime of your test suite. Excessive use of retries on numerous tests could significantly increase feedback time during development.

By understanding and implementing the test retry mechanism within MorningAI projects, developers can significantly improve the robustness and reliability of their automated testing processes.
