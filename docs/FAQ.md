# E2E Testing in MorningAI

End-to-end (E2E) testing is a crucial aspect of ensuring the reliability and functionality of the MorningAI platform. This FAQ aims to guide developers through the process of setting up, running, and troubleshooting E2E tests within the MorningAI environment.

## What is E2E Testing?

E2E testing involves testing the entire software application from start to finish. It ensures that all integrated components function together as expected in a scenario that mimics real-world usage. In the context of MorningAI, E2E tests validate the interactions between the autonomous agent system, FAQ generation, documentation management, multi-platform integration, and real-time task orchestration.

## Setting Up E2E Tests

Before running E2E tests, ensure your development environment is correctly set up:

1. Install all necessary dependencies:
   - Ensure Node.js and npm are installed.
   - Install Cypress or your chosen E2E testing framework.

```bash
npm install cypress --save-dev
```

2. Configure your test scripts in `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "e2e": "cypress open"
}
```

3. Ensure your application and any dependent services (like Redis Queue or PostgreSQL) are running either locally or in a test environment accessible to the testing framework.

## Writing E2E Tests

When writing E2E tests for MorningAI, consider scenarios that involve multiple components interacting with each other. Here's an example using Cypress for a test case that verifies successful user login through the UI:

```javascript
describe('Login Test', () => {
  it('Successfully logs in', () => {
    cy.visit('/login');
    cy.get('input[name="username"]').type('testuser');
    cy.get('input[name="password"]').type('password123');
    cy.get('button[type="submit"]').click();

    // Verify login by checking if the dashboard is visible
    cy.url().should('include', '/dashboard');
  });
});
```

## Running E2E Tests

To run your E2E tests, execute the test script defined in `package.json`:

```bash
npm run e2e
```

This will launch the Cypress Test Runner, from which you can select and run individual test suites or all tests.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Tests Fail to Connect to Local Services**: Ensure all services (backend server, Redis Queue, etc.) are running before executing tests. Check service logs for any startup errors.
- **Flaky Tests**: Flaky tests often result from timing issues or assumptions about state. Use Cypress commands like `cy.wait()` sparingly and ensure your tests reset state before each test where feasible.
- **Database State**: For tests involving database operations, consider using tools like pgvector/Supabase for vector memory storage with rollback capabilities to reset database state before each test suite runs.

For more detailed guidance on writing and troubleshooting specific types of tests within MorningAI's architecture, refer to our developer documentation:
- [Cypress Documentation](https://docs.cypress.io)
- [MorningAI Developer Guides](https://github.com/RC918/morningai/docs/developer_guides)

Remember, consistent and comprehensive E2E testing is key to maintaining high-quality software delivery pipelines. Ensuring your tests cover critical user journeys can significantly reduce bugs and improve user satisfaction with MorningAI.
