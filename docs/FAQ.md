# System Architecture of MorningAI

MorningAI leverages a modern, scalable, and resilient architecture designed to support autonomous agent systems for code generation, FAQ generation, documentation management, and multi-platform integration. Our architecture ensures high availability, performance, and scalability to meet the demands of our users. Below is a comprehensive explanation of the system architecture at MorningAI.

## Overview

The MorningAI platform is built on a microservices-based architecture that includes the following key components:

- **Frontend**: Developed with React, Vite, and TailwindCSS for a responsive and modern user interface.
- **Backend**: Utilizes Python with Flask and Gunicorn with multi-worker support for handling backend logic and API requests.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL is used for data persistence, with Supabase adding additional features such as Row Level Security (RLS) for enhanced data protection.
- **Queue**: Redis Queue (RQ) is implemented for task queuing to manage background jobs efficiently.
- **Orchestration**: LangGraph is used for orchestrating agent workflows, ensuring tasks are executed in the correct order.
- **AI**: OpenAI's GPT-4 powers content generation and autonomous agent decisions.
- **Deployment**: Render.com provides hosting with Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) capabilities to streamline updates.

### Frontend

The frontend utilizes React along with Vite as the build tool for fast development experiences. TailwindCSS is used for styling, offering utility-first CSS classes that make designing components straightforward.

```jsx
// Example: src/App.jsx
import React from 'react';
import './App.css';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <header className="App-header">
        Welcome to MorningAI
      </header>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

### Backend

Our backend is developed in Python using Flask as the web framework and Gunicorn as the WSGI HTTP Server. Gunicorn's multi-worker support allows our application to handle multiple requests simultaneously.

```python
# Example: app.py
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello from MorningAI Backend!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

### Database Configuration

We utilize PostgreSQL for our database needs, with Supabase adding powerful features like Row Level Security (RLS). Here's an example of setting up a table with RLS in SQL:

```sql
-- Create a secure table
CREATE TABLE secure_data (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    data TEXT NOT NULL
);

-- Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE secure_data ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Add a policy
CREATE POLICY user_own_data ON secure_data FOR ALL USING (user_id = auth.uid());
```

### Redis Queue (RQ)

Redis Queue (RQ) is used to handle background tasks. Here's how you can define a simple job function and enqueue it:

```python
# Example: tasks.py
from redis import Redis
from rq import Queue

q = Queue(connection=Redis())

def say_hello(name):
    print(f"Hello {name}")

# Enqueue the task
job = q.enqueue(say_hello, 'MorningAI')
```

### Common Troubleshooting Tips

1. **Frontend Issues**: Ensure all npm packages are up to date. Clearing the cache (`npm cache clean --force`) can resolve many issues.
2. **Backend Connectivity**: Verify that Gunicorn is running and accessible. Check firewall rules if running on a remote server.
3. **Database Access**: For Supabase/PostgreSQL issues, ensure your connection strings are correctly configured and that RLS policies do not inadvertently block access.
4. **Redis Queue Jobs Not Processing**: Ensure Redis server is running and that RQ workers are started (`rq worker`).
