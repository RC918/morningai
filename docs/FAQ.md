# MorningAI System Architecture

MorningAI employs a modern, scalable, and robust system architecture designed to facilitate rapid development, efficient operation, and easy maintenance. This architecture supports autonomous agent systems for code generation, FAQ generation, documentation management, multi-platform integration, real-time task orchestration with Redis Queue, and vector memory storage with pgvector/Supabase.

## Overview

At its core, MorningAI leverages a microservices architecture pattern which is split across several key components:

- **Frontend**: Developed with React and styled using TailwindCSS. The project utilizes Vite for an optimized development experience and faster build times.
- **Backend**: The server-side logic is handled by Flask (a Python web framework) running on Gunicorn with multi-worker support for handling concurrent requests efficiently.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL is used as the primary data store, enhanced with Row Level Security (RLS) on Supabase for added data protection. pgvector is utilized within Supabase for vector memory storage capabilities.
- **Queue System**: Redis Queue (RQ) is integrated for managing background jobs and real-time task orchestration. Worker heartbeat monitoring ensures system reliability and fault tolerance.
- **Orchestration**: LangGraph is employed for defining and executing agent workflows within the system.
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI's GPT-4 model powers the content generation features, including FAQ generation.
- **Deployment**: The entire stack is deployed on Render.com, benefiting from its Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines for seamless updates.

### Code Example: Flask Application Setup

Below is an example of how to set up a basic Flask application within this architecture:

```python
from flask import Flask
from flask_cors import CORS

app = Flask(__name__)
CORS(app)

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello, MorningAI!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

This code snippet illustrates creating a simple Flask application that responds to root URL requests with "Hello, MorningAI!".

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

### Issue: Flask Application Not Starting

Ensure Gunicorn is correctly configured with workers and threads. A common start command may look like this:

```shell
gunicorn -w 4 -k gthread app:app
```

### Issue: Database Connection Errors

Verify the database connection strings in your environment variables. Ensure Supabase access tokens are up-to-date and have the necessary permissions.

### Issue: Redis Queue Jobs Not Processing

Check if Redis workers are running. You can start a worker with:

```shell
rq worker
```

Ensure your RQ worker has access to your environment variables and the correct Redis URL.
