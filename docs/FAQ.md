# System Architecture of MorningAI

The system architecture of MorningAI is designed to support scalable, efficient, and robust autonomous agent systems for code generation, FAQ generation, documentation management, and multi-platform integration. Below is a comprehensive breakdown of the key components and how they interact within the MorningAI platform.

## Overview

MorningAI leverages a microservices architecture, utilizing a combination of modern technologies to ensure high availability, scalability, and seamless integration across various platforms including Telegram, LINE, and Messenger. The main components of the system architecture include:

- **Frontend**: Built with React, Vite, and TailwindCSS for a responsive and modern user interface.
- **Backend**: Python with Flask serving as the API layer, and Gunicorn with multi-worker support for handling concurrent requests efficiently.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL powered by Supabase, featuring Row Level Security (RLS) for enhanced data security.
- **Queue**: Redis Queue (RQ) is used for task scheduling and real-time task orchestration.
- **Orchestration**: LangGraph manages agent workflows within the platform.
- **AI Module**: Integrates OpenAI's GPT-4 for advanced content generation capabilities.
- **Deployment**: Hosted on Render.com with Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines in place.

### Detailed Components Interaction

1. **Frontend to Backend Communication**:
   - The frontend communicates with the backend via RESTful APIs or WebSocket connections for real-time features.
   - Example: Fetching generated FAQs from the backend.
   ```javascript
   fetch('/api/faqs')
     .then(response => response.json())
     .then(data => console.log(data));
   ```

2. **Backend Services**:
   - Flask applications handle HTTP requests and route them to appropriate services such as content generation or task orchestration.
   - Gunicorn serves as the WSGI server with multiple workers to handle requests in parallel.

3. **Task Orchestration**:
   - Real-time tasks are managed through Redis Queue (RQ), facilitating asynchronous execution of operations like content generation.
   - Workers pick up tasks from RQ and process them using defined workflows in LangGraph.

4. **Data Storage**:
   - PostgreSQL database managed by Supabase offers structured data storage with Row Level Security for access control.
   - Vector memory storage solutions like pgvector are utilized for efficient search operations.

5. **AI Integration**:
   - The AI module powered by OpenAI's GPT-4 is integral for generating high-quality content based on user inputs or automated tasks.

6. **Deployment & CI/CD**:
   - Render.com hosts the application with CI/CD pipelines setup for automatic testing and deployment upon code changes.

### Common Troubleshooting Tips

1. **Backend Service Unresponsive**:
    - Ensure Gunicorn is running with an adequate number of workers.
    - Check server logs for any unhandled exceptions or errors in request processing.

2. **Database Connection Issues**:
    - Verify database credentials and network configurations.
    - Ensure Row Level Security policies do not inadvertently block legitimate queries.

3. **Tasks Stuck in Redis Queue**:
    - Investigate worker logs for errors or deadlocks.
    - Confirm that RQ workers are running and heartbeat signals are received.

4. **Content Generation Errors**:
    - Validate input data formats and ensure they meet the expected schema required by GPT-4 APIs.
    - Check API usage quotas if using external services like OpenAI.
