# Testing Sentry Trace ID in MorningAI

When integrating or debugging applications, tracing errors and performance issues is crucial. Sentry is a powerful tool used in MorningAI for error tracking and performance monitoring. Understanding how to test and utilize the `trace_id` can significantly improve your development workflow by enabling you to trace events and errors back to their source. This guide covers how to test and work with Sentry `trace_id` within the MorningAI platform.

## Understanding Sentry `trace_id`

The `trace_id` is a unique identifier assigned to every event or transaction captured by Sentry. It allows developers to trace an issue across different services and components in a distributed system, making it easier to debug and resolve issues.

### How It Works in MorningAI

In MorningAI, every API call, background job, or task that might fail or cause performance issues is tracked. When an error occurs or a performance issue is detected, Sentry captures the event along with its `trace_id`. This ID can then be used to trace the event through the system's logs or within Sentry's dashboard.

## Code Example: Capturing a Trace ID

To capture a `trace_id` in your application, you'll need to ensure that Sentry SDK is correctly initialized and configured in your Flask application. Here's a basic example of how it could look:

```python
from flask import Flask
from sentry_sdk import init, capture_message

# Initialize your Flask app
app = Flask(__name__)

# Initialize Sentry SDK with your DSN
init(dsn="your_sentry_dsn_here")

@app.route('/test-sentry')
def test_sentry():
    # This will capture a message in Sentry and return the associated trace ID.
    with capture_message("Testing Sentry Integration", level='info') as scope:
        return f"Sentry event captured with trace_id: {scope.span.trace_id}"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()
```

This simple Flask route captures a message in Sentry and returns the `trace_id` associated with that event.

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

1. **Missing Trace IDs**: If you're not seeing `trace_id`s in your events, ensure that your Sentry SDK is up-to-date and correctly initialized before any event is captured.
2. **Incorrect Configuration**: Double-check your DSN (Data Source Name) configuration. An incorrect DSN means your events won't reach Sentry.
3. **Network Issues**: Sometimes, network configurations can block requests to external services like Sentry. Ensure that your network allows outgoing requests to Sentry's endpoints.
4. **Debug Mode**: While testing, enable debug mode in the Sentry SDK initialization to get more insight into what might be going wrong.
