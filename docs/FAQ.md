# Handling Redis Outages in MorningAI

Redis Queue (RQ) is a critical component of the MorningAI platform, enabling real-time task orchestration and efficient job processing. However, like any technology, it may occasionally experience outages or downtime. This FAQ aims to guide developers on how to manage and mitigate the effects of a Redis outage in the MorningAI environment.

## Understanding the Impact of a Redis Outage

When Redis experiences an outage, it can significantly affect several aspects of the MorningAI platform, including:

- **Task Queuing:** Delay in processing or complete halt of new tasks.
- **Real-time Orchestration:** Disruption in real-time task orchestration.
- **Worker Heartbeat Monitoring:** Inability to monitor worker health.

## Preparing for a Redis Outage

### Code Examples

To ensure resilience and continuity of service, consider implementing fallback mechanisms and error handling in your codebase. Here's an example in Python using Flask:

```python
from redis.exceptions import RedisError
from rq import Queue
from worker import conn

queue = Queue(connection=conn)

def enqueue_task(task_func, *args, **kwargs):
    try:
        queue.enqueue(task_func, *args, **kwargs)
    except RedisError as e:
        # Implement your fallback logic here
        # For example: Log the error and retry later or use a different queue/backend
        print(f"Failed to enqueue task due to Redis error: {e}")
```

### Configuration Tips

- **Connection Retries:** Configure your Redis client to automatically retry connections. This can be helpful for transient network issues or short outages.
  
  ```python
  redis_conn = Redis(host='localhost', port=6379, db=0, retry_on_timeout=True, socket_connect_timeout=5)
  ```

- **Health Checks:** Implement periodic health checks for your Redis instance to quickly detect and respond to outages.

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

### Verifying Redis Service Status

First, check if the Redis service is running:

```bash
sudo systemctl status redis
```

If not running, attempt to restart it:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart redis
```

### Inspecting Logs for Errors

Review the Redis logs for any error messages that could indicate why the service is down:

```bash
cat /var/log/redis/redis-server.log
```

### Network Connectivity Issues

Ensure there are no network connectivity issues between your application server and the Redis server:

```bash
ping <REDIS_SERVER_IP>
```

### Memory Pressure

High memory usage can cause issues with Redis performance or availability. Check system memory usage and consider configuring max memory limits in `redis.conf`.

```bash
free -m
```

Add or adjust this line in `redis.conf`:

```conf
maxmemory <size>
```

Replace `<size>` with an appropriate limit for your server.
