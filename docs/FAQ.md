# Testing Sentry Trace ID in MorningAI

Sentry is a powerful error tracking system that helps developers monitor and fix crashes in real-time. In the context of MorningAI, Sentry's `trace_id` plays a critical role in debugging by allowing developers to trace the sequence of events leading up to an error. This FAQ aims to guide you on how to test and utilize Sentry `trace_id` within the MorningAI platform.

## Understanding Sentry Trace ID

A `trace_id` in Sentry is a unique identifier for a set of operations that are executed as part of a single trace. It provides a way to connect events across multiple services, making it easier to pinpoint where and why an error occurred.

### How to Implement and Test Sentry Trace ID

To implement and test Sentry `trace_id` in MorningAI, follow these steps:

1. **Integration with MorningAI**:
   Ensure that Sentry is integrated into the MorningAI platform. This typically involves adding the Sentry SDK to your project and configuring it with your DSN (Data Source Name).

   ```python
   # Example Python setup for Flask application in MorningAI
   import sentry_sdk
   from sentry_sdk.integrations.flask import FlaskIntegration
   
   sentry_sdk.init(
       dsn="your_sentry_dsn_here",
       integrations=[FlaskIntegration()]
   )
   ```

2. **Generating a Trace ID**:
   When an error occurs, Sentry automatically generates a `trace_id`. This ID can be found within the event details in your Sentry dashboard.

3. **Testing Trace ID**:
   To test the functionality, deliberately induce an error in your code where Sentry is configured. For example:

   ```python
   @app.route("/error")
   def trigger_error():
       division_by_zero = 1 / 0  # This will cause a ZeroDivisionError
       return division_by_zero
   ```

4. **Verifying Trace ID**:
   After triggering an error, go to your Sentry dashboard and open the corresponding event. The `trace_id` should be visible in the event details.

### Common Troubleshooting Tips

- **Missing Trace IDs**: If `trace_id`s are not appearing in your Sentry dashboard, ensure that the Sentry SDK is correctly initialized and that your network policies allow outbound requests to Sentry's servers.
  
- **Incorrect Configuration**: Double-check your DSN configuration if errors are not being reported. A common mistake is using incorrect or outdated DSN values.
  
- **Performance Issues**: Monitoring too many transactions or errors might impact application performance. Use sampling to balance between observability and performance.

Remember, effectively utilizing `trace_id` can significantly improve your ability to debug and resolve issues within the MorningAI platform.
