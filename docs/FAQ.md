# Testing Sentry Trace_ID in MorningAI

Understanding and utilizing the Sentry `trace_id` within the MorningAI platform is crucial for tracking and debugging transactions across services. This FAQ provides an in-depth look at how to test and implement Sentry `trace_id` effectively.

## What is Sentry `trace_id`?

Sentry's `trace_id` is a unique identifier used to trace events and transactions across multiple systems or microservices. In a distributed system like MorningAI, it helps developers track the flow of requests and identify issues or bottlenecks within specific parts of the application.

## How to Implement and Test Sentry `trace_id` in MorningAI

### Implementation

To implement Sentry tracing in MorningAI, you need to integrate Sentry with your application first. Assuming you have Sentry set up, here's how to use `trace_id`:

1. **Add Sentry SDK**: Ensure the Sentry SDK is added to your project. For Python applications (like the backend of MorningAI), you would do something like:

```python
import sentry_sdk
sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="your_sentry_dsn",
    traces_sample_rate=1.0,  # Adjust sample rate as needed
)
```

2. **Capture Trace ID**: When initializing a transaction or event that you want to trace, capture and log the `trace_id`. For example:

```python
from sentry_sdk import start_transaction

with start_transaction(op="test", name="Test Operation") as transaction:
    # Your code logic here
    print(f"Trace ID: {transaction.trace_id}")
```

### Testing

To test if `trace_id` is working correctly:

1. **Generate Transactions**: Execute operations in your application that trigger the code paths where Sentry transactions are captured.
2. **Check Logs**: Verify that the `trace_id` is being logged as expected.
3. **Sentry Dashboard**: Go to your Sentry dashboard and search for the `trace_id`. You should be able to find related events or transactions, indicating that tracing is working.

### Common Troubleshooting Tips

- **Traces Not Appearing**: If traces are not appearing in your Sentry dashboard, check if the `traces_sample_rate` is correctly configured and not set too low.
- **Incorrect Trace ID**: Ensure that the `trace_id` is being captured and logged in the correct scope of your transaction. Misplacement can lead to incorrect or missing trace IDs.
- **Performance Overhead**: Be mindful of the performance impact of setting a high `traces_sample_rate`, especially in production environments.

By following these guidelines, developers should be able to effectively implement and test Sentry tracing within their components of the MorningAI platform, leading to better observability and issue resolution capabilities.
