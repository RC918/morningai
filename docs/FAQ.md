# Handling Redis Outage in MorningAI

In the event of a Redis outage, MorningAI's real-time task orchestration and queue management functionalities may be affected. This FAQ provides guidance on understanding the impact of a Redis outage on MorningAI and outlines steps to mitigate issues.

## Understanding the Impact of a Redis Outage

Redis Queue (RQ) is integral to MorningAI for managing background tasks and orchestrating real-time operations. An outage can result in:
- Delays or failures in executing asynchronous tasks.
- Interruptions in real-time data processing and task orchestration.
- Potential inconsistencies in task status tracking.

### Code Example: Monitoring Redis Queue Health

To monitor the health of your Redis Queue, you can implement a simple health check endpoint in your Flask application:

```python
from flask import Flask, jsonify
import redis

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/health/redis', methods=['GET'])
def check_redis():
    try:
        r = redis.Redis(host='localhost', port=6379, db=0)
        r.ping()
        return jsonify({"status": "Redis is up"}), 200
    except redis.ConnectionError:
        return jsonify({"status": "Redis is down"}), 503

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

This endpoint attempts to ping your Redis instance and returns the status accordingly.

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

1. **Verify Redis Server Status**: Ensure that your Redis server is running by using the command `redis-cli ping`. If it's running, you should receive a `PONG` response.
2. **Check Network Connectivity**: Sometimes, network issues can cause disruptions in connecting to the Redis server. Verify network connectivity and firewall rules.
3. **Review Application Logs**: Check your application logs for any error messages related to Redis connections or task executions. This can provide insights into what might be causing the issue.
4. **Restart Services**: In some cases, restarting your Flask application and the Redis service can resolve transient issues.
5. **Backup and Restore**: Ensure you have recent backups of your Redis data. In case of data corruption or loss during an outage, you'll be able to restore from a backup.

For further details on configuring and managing your Redis instances with MorningAI, refer to the documentation in `RC918/morningai/docs/setup.md`.

Remember, while handling outages, maintaining clear communication within your team and implementing robust monitoring will significantly aid in quick resolution.
