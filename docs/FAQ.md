# Test Retry Mechanism in MorningAI

The MorningAI platform incorporates a robust test retry mechanism designed to enhance the reliability and stability of our autonomous agent system and integration features. This FAQ aims to provide developers with a thorough understanding of how test retries work within the MorningAI environment, including configuration, implementation examples, and troubleshooting tips.

## Understanding Test Retries

Test retries in MorningAI are crucial for handling transient errors or flakiness in network communications, services dependencies, or even intermittent issues within the codebase itself. By automatically retrying failed tests under certain conditions, we can ensure more reliable outcomes without manual intervention.

### Configuration

Test retries can be configured at both the suite and individual test levels. Configuration parameters include the maximum number of retries and specific conditions under which a retry should be triggered.

Example configuration in Python (using pytest as an illustration):

```python
# In pytest.ini or conftest.py
def pytest_configure(config):
    config.addinivalue_line("reruns", "2")  # Max retries
    config.addinivalue_line("reruns_delay", "5")  # Delay between retries in seconds
```

For integration with MorningAI's task orchestration, refer to the specific task handler settings in your `task_handler.py` under the root directory of your project:

```python
# Example task handler configuration for retry
from morningai.orchestration import TaskHandler

task_handler = TaskHandler(retry_attempts=3, retry_delay=10)
```

### Implementation Example

When implementing a test that might require retries due to its reliance on external services or other factors, structure your code to gracefully handle potential transient failures.

```python
import requests
from morningai.retry import retry_on_failure

@retry_on_failure(attempts=3, delay_seconds=5)
def test_external_api_call():
    response = requests.get("https://api.example.com/data")
    assert response.status_code == 200
```

This example uses a decorator from MorningAI's utility module to automatically retry the test up to three times with a five-second delay if it fails.

### Common Troubleshooting Tips

1. **Tests Not Retrying**: Ensure your retry configurations are correctly set in your test suite or individual tests. Double-check syntax and parameter values.
2. **Excessive Delays Due to Retries**: Adjust the number of retry attempts and delay intervals based on historical data about transient errors' frequency and duration.
3. **Identifying Flaky Tests**: Utilize logging within your tests to identify patterns that may suggest flakiness. Consider redesigning tests or mocking external dependencies more reliably.
4. **Dependency Issues**: If retries are related to external service dependencies, verify network stability and service availability during testing windows.

By following these guidelines and leveraging MorningAI's test retry mechanisms, developers can significantly improve their testing strategies' robustness and reliability.
