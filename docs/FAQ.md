# Handling MorningAI During a Redis Outage

Redis plays a crucial role in MorningAI's architecture, particularly in managing real-time task queues for autonomous agent system code generation and task orchestration. A Redis outage can significantly impact the platform's performance and functionality. This FAQ provides guidance on how to understand and manage such an event.

## Understanding the Impact of a Redis Outage

When Redis is not available, several features of MorningAI may be directly affected:

- **Task Orchestration:** MorningAI uses Redis Queue (RQ) for managing background jobs. An outage means tasks cannot be queued or executed.
- **Real-Time Operations:** Any feature relying on real-time execution or updates will face delays or outright failures.
- **Session Management:** If Redis is used for session storage, user sessions might be lost or fail to update.

## Immediate Actions During a Redis Outage

1. **Check Redis Health**: Confirm the outage by checking the Redis instance health. Tools like `redis-cli ping` can quickly show if Redis is responsive.

    ```bash
    redis-cli ping
    ```

2. **Review Logs**: Check your application and Redis logs for any error messages or warnings that can indicate what caused the outage.

    ```plaintext
    # Example path to Redis logs
    /var/log/redis/redis-server.log
    ```

3. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Implement temporary fallback mechanisms if critical features must remain online, like queuing tasks in memory (with limitations) or using another database as a temporary store.

4. **Notify Users**: If the outage affects users, communicate proactively about the issue and expected resolution time.

## Preventive Measures and Configuration Tips

- **High Availability Setup**: Configure your Redis setup for high availability (HA) using Redis Sentinel or clustering.
- **Regular Backups**: Ensure you have regular backups of your Redis data to recover quickly from data loss incidents.
- **Monitoring and Alerts**: Use monitoring tools to track the health of your Redis instance and set up alerts for early detection of issues.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Connection Errors**: Ensure that network policies or firewalls are not blocking connections to your Redis instance.
- **Resource Constraints**: Monitor and allocate sufficient resources (CPU, memory) to your Redis server to handle the load.
- **Configuration Issues**: Validate your configuration settings, especially if recent changes were made before the outage.
