# Testing Sentry `trace_id` in MorningAI

Understanding and utilizing the `trace_id` within Sentry in the MorningAI platform is crucial for effective debugging and monitoring of your application. This FAQ entry aims to provide a comprehensive overview of how to test and use the `trace_id` effectively within the context of MorningAI.

## What is `trace_id`?

In Sentry, the `trace_id` is a unique identifier for a set of events or transactions that represent a single instance of a service call or workflow. It is instrumental in tracing the path that a process has taken through your code and infrastructure, making it easier to diagnose and debug issues.

## How to Test `trace_id` in MorningAI

### Step 1: Ensure Sentry Integration

First, confirm that Sentry integration is correctly set up in your MorningAI application. This involves adding Sentry SDK to your project dependencies and configuring it in your application's initialization code.

#### Example Initialization (Python Flask Application):

```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.flask import FlaskIntegration

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="your_sentry_dsn_here",
    integrations=[FlaskIntegration()]
)
```

Replace `"your_sentry_dsn_here"` with your actual Sentry DSN. This code should be added to your Flask app initialization script, commonly found in `app/__init__.py`.

### Step 2: Generate a Transaction with `trace_id`

When you want to test or utilize the `trace_id`, you can create a transaction manually within your code. This transaction will then appear in Sentry with its corresponding `trace_id`.

#### Example Transaction Creation:

```python
from sentry_sdk import start_transaction

with start_transaction(op="test", name="Test Transaction"):
    # Your test code here
    pass
```

This snippet starts a new transaction named "Test Transaction" that you can look for in Sentry's dashboard.

### Step 3: Retrieve and Use `trace_id`

After generating transactions, you can find their `trace_id`s in the Sentry UI by navigating to the specific transaction details. These IDs can be used for correlating logs, debugging issues across microservices, or linking errors reported by users to specific backend operations.

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

- **Missing Transactions**: If transactions are not appearing in Sentry, ensure that the SDK initialization is correct and happens early in your application's startup sequence.
- **Incorrect `trace_id`**: If the `trace_id` does not match between services, ensure that you are forwarding the trace context correctly when making service calls.
- **Performance Overhead**: Be mindful of creating too many transactions or very detailed ones, as this can introduce performance overhead. Use sampling to balance detail with performance.
