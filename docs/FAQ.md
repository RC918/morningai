# MorningAI System Architecture

MorningAI's system architecture is designed to facilitate a scalable, efficient, and robust multi-tenant SaaS platform. It incorporates a combination of modern technologies and practices to support autonomous agent systems for code generation, documentation management, multi-platform integration, real-time task orchestration, and vector memory storage. Below is an overview of the key components and how they interact within the MorningAI ecosystem.

## Key Components:

### Frontend
- **Technologies**: React for building user interfaces with efficiency and flexibility; Vite as the build tool for a fast development environment; TailwindCSS for styling with utility-first CSS.
- **Architecture**: The frontend is structured as a single-page application (SPA) that interacts with the backend through RESTful APIs or GraphQL queries (if used). It is designed to be responsive and adaptive to different screen sizes and devices.

### Backend
- **Technologies**: Python with Flask as the micro web framework providing the simplicity and flexibility needed for our services; Gunicorn as the WSGI HTTP Server for UNIX, supporting multi-worker processes for handling concurrent requests.
- **Architecture**: The backend follows a clean architecture pattern, separating concerns into distinct layers (Controllers, Services, Repositories) to enhance maintainability and scalability. It handles API requests, processes business logic, performs authentication/authorization, and manages data persistence.

### Database
- **Technology**: PostgreSQL enhanced by Supabase for real-time subscriptions, authentication, instant APIs, and more. Supabase adds powerful features like Row Level Security (RLS) to PostgreSQL.
- **Structure**: Our database schema is designed to support multi-tenancy from the ground up with a focus on security and performance. Tables are organized around core entities such as users, projects, tasks, etc., with RLS policies enforcing access control at the data layer.

### Queue
- **Technology**: Redis Queue (RQ) facilitates asynchronous task execution allowing long-running tasks to be processed in the background without blocking the main application flow.
- **Usage**: Tasks related to code generation or external API calls are queued in RQ for execution. Workers pull tasks from the queue based on priority and availability.

### Orchestration
- **Technology**: LangGraph is used for defining agent workflows that enable autonomous decision-making based on predefined logic.
- **Integration**: It interacts closely with both the backend (for triggering actions) and the queue system (for managing task flows).

### AI
- **Technology**: OpenAI's GPT-4 powers content generation including FAQ content like this document. 
- **Application**: It's used across various parts of MorningAI for generating code snippets, creating documentation content dynamically, and answering user queries through integrated platforms.

### Deployment
- **Platform**: Render.com provides cloud hosting services with CI/CD support ensuring smooth deployments and updates to our infrastructure.
- **Process**: We use Docker containers orchestrated via Render's native tools which automate builds from our Git repository upon new commits to specified branches.

## Code Examples

Due to the broad nature of this topic, specific code examples would vary widely depending on the component discussed. However, developers looking to interact with each part of the stack can refer to sample endpoints in Flask:

```python
# Sample Flask route in `app/routes.py`
@app.route('/api/v1/tasks', methods=['POST'])
def create_task():
    # Task creation logic here
    return jsonify({"success": True}), 201

# RQ task example in `app/tasks.py`
from rq import Queue
from worker import conn

q = Queue(connection=conn)

def background_task(arg):
    print(f"Task running with argument {arg}")
    # Task logic here
    return f"Task completed with argument {arg}"

result = q.enqueue(background_task, 'example')
```

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

1. **Frontend not updating after backend changes**:
   - Ensure your build process is running (`npm run dev` or `vite`) and check if there are any proxy settings required in `vite.config.js` for your API endpoints.
2. **Database connection issues**:
   - Verify your Supabase connection strings are correctly set in your environment variables. Check network access rules if running locally versus in production.
3. **Tasks not being processed by workers**:
   - Confirm that your Redis server is running and accessible. Check worker logs for errors or exceptions during task processing.
4. **Deployment failures on Render.com**:
   - Review build logs on Render's dashboard for specific errors during deployment. Ensure Dockerfile is correctly set up if using containerized deployment.
