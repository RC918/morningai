# MorningAI System Architecture

The system architecture of MorningAI is designed to support scalable, efficient, and robust autonomous agent system for code generation, FAQ generation, documentation management, and multi-platform integration. This architecture leverages a microservices-based approach, utilizing a combination of modern technologies and frameworks to ensure high performance and reliability.

## Overview

MorningAI's architecture is composed of several key components working together:

- **Frontend**: Developed with React, Vite, and TailwindCSS for a responsive and modern user interface.
- **Backend**: Utilizes Python and Flask framework with Gunicorn as the WSGI HTTP Server for multi-worker support, ensuring efficient handling of requests.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL is used for data persistence, enhanced with Row Level Security (RLS) features provided by Supabase for secure data access.
- **Queue System**: Redis Queue (RQ) handles task queuing to manage background jobs effectively, with worker heartbeat monitoring to ensure reliability.
- **Orchestration**: LangGraph is used for orchestrating agent workflows, providing a flexible framework for task management.
- **AI Integration**: Incorporates OpenAI's GPT-4 for advanced content generation capabilities.
- **Deployment**: Hosted on Render.com with continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines set up for smooth deployments.

## Detailed Architecture

### Frontend

The frontend is developed using React for building user interfaces with Vite as the build tool for fast development cycles and TailwindCSS for styling. The structure can be found under `frontend/` directory.

```jsx
// Example: frontend/src/App.jsx
import React from 'react';
import './App.css';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <header className="App-header">
        {/* Content goes here */}
      </header>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

### Backend

The backend leverages Flask as a lightweight WSGI web application framework. Gunicorn serves as the HTTP server with support for multiple workers. Configuration details can be found in `backend/gunicorn_config.py`.

```python
# Example: backend/gunicorn_config.py
workers = 2
threads = 4
timeout = 120
```

### Database

PostgreSQL is used as the database solution, with Supabase adding additional functionalities like Row Level Security. Database schemas and migrations are located in `database/migrations/`.

### Queue System

Redis Queue (RQ) is utilized for managing background tasks. Worker processes are managed through RQ dashboard or programmatically via the Python RQ library.

```python
from redis import Redis
from rq import Queue

redis_conn = Redis()
q = Queue(connection=redis_conn)

# Example: Enqueueing a task
job = q.enqueue('my_module.my_function', args=(my_arg,))
```

### Orchestration & AI Integration

LangGraph orchestrates the workflow of autonomous agents while leveraging OpenAI's GPT-4 for content generation tasks. The integration layer is designed to facilitate communication between different components seamlessly.

### Deployment

Deployed on Render.com, the project benefits from automatic deployments through CI/CD pipelines configured in `render.yaml`. This ensures that updates are smoothly rolled out without manual intervention.

## Troubleshooting Tips

1. **Frontend Build Issues**: Ensure all dependencies are correctly installed using `npm install` or `yarn install`. Check browser console logs for specific errors.
2. **Backend Server Errors**: Review Gunicorn logs for error details. Ensure Flask app is correctly configured and all routes are defined properly.
3. **Database Connection Issues**: Verify PostgreSQL credentials and network access settings in Supabase. Ensure migrations are applied correctly.
4. **Redis Queue Jobs Failing**: Check RQ dashboard or logs for job failure reasons. Ensure Redis server is running and accessible by worker processes.
5. **Deployment Failures**: Consult Render.com deployment logs to identify issues in the build or deployment process. Ensure `render.yaml` file is correctly configured.
