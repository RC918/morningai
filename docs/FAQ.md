# Handling Redis Outage in MorningAI

Redis plays a crucial role in MorningAI's real-time task orchestration, particularly with the Redis Queue (RQ) managing background tasks efficiently. An outage or disruption in Redis connectivity can significantly impact the platform's performance and reliability. This FAQ aims to provide developers with guidance on how to handle and mitigate issues arising from a Redis outage within the MorningAI platform.

## Understanding the Impact of a Redis Outage

When Redis becomes unavailable, MorningAI may experience delays or failures in task processing. This is because the platform relies on Redis Queue (RQ) for queuing tasks and worker heartbeat monitoring. Tasks that cannot be queued will either fail immediately or timeout, depending on their configuration.

### Key Components Affected:

- **Real-time Task Orchestration**: Task scheduling and execution may be halted.
- **Worker Heartbeat Monitoring**: The ability to monitor the health and status of background workers is compromised.

## Steps to Mitigate Redis Outage Issues

### 1. Immediate Actions During an Outage

- **Monitor the System**: Use logging and monitoring tools to assess the impact. Monitor `logs/redis_outage.log` for real-time errors and system alerts.
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Implement a fallback mechanism where critical tasks can either be retried later or handled through an alternative pathway.

```python
# Example of a fallback mechanism in Flask app
from flask import current_app
from rq import get_current_job
from redis.exceptions import RedisError

def handle_task():
    try:
        job = get_current_job()
        # Task logic here
    except RedisError as e:
        current_app.logger.error(f'Redis error encountered: {e}')
        # Fallback logic here
```

### 2. Post-Outage Recovery

- **Data Consistency Checks**: Ensure that data processed during the outage is consistent with your application's state.
- **Review and Retry Failed Tasks**: Examine `failed_jobs` queue and consider manually retrying critical tasks if necessary.

```python
# Example of retrying failed jobs in RQ
from redis import Redis
from rq import Connection, Queue

redis_conn = Redis()
with Connection(redis_conn):
    failed_queue = Queue('failed', connection=redis_conn)
    for job in failed_queue.jobs:
        job.retry()
```

### 3. Preventive Measures

- **High Availability Setup**: Consider setting up a high availability (HA) configuration for Redis to minimize downtime.
- **Implement Caching Strategies**: Use caching mechanisms to temporarily store critical data that might be needed during an outage.

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

- **Connection Errors**: Ensure your application correctly handles connection errors by implementing retries with exponential backoff.
- **Task Timeouts**: Adjust task timeout settings to account for temporary network or service interruptions.
- **Monitor Redis Health**: Regularly monitor Redis health and performance metrics to anticipate potential issues before they result in outages.
