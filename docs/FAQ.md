# System Architecture of MorningAI

The system architecture of MorningAI is designed to support a scalable, multi-tenant SaaS platform that offers a range of services including autonomous code generation, FAQ and documentation management, multi-platform integration, real-time task orchestration, and vector memory storage. Below is a comprehensive breakdown of the architecture components and how they interact within the MorningAI ecosystem.

## Overview

MorningAI's architecture is built on a microservices model, leveraging various technologies to ensure robustness, scalability, and ease of maintenance. The key components of this architecture include:

- **Frontend**: Developed with React, utilizing Vite for an optimized build toolchain and TailwindCSS for styling.
- **Backend**: Python-based using Flask as the web framework and Gunicorn as the WSGI HTTP Server with multi-worker support for handling concurrent requests efficiently.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL hosted on Supabase, configured with Row Level Security (RLS) to ensure data isolation across different tenants.
- **Queue System**: Redis Queue (RQ) is used for managing background jobs with worker heartbeat monitoring to handle task execution in real-time.
- **Orchestration**: LangGraph is employed for managing agent workflows, facilitating complex operations that require coordination between different services.
- **AI Layer**: OpenAI GPT-4 powers the content generation, including code and documentation.
- **Deployment**: Render.com is used for hosting with continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) practices in place to streamline updates.

## Detailed Components

### Frontend

```javascript
// Example: src/main.js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import './index.css';
import App from './App';
import 'tailwindcss/tailwind.css'

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

This snippet showcases the entry point for the React application, incorporating TailwindCSS for styling.

### Backend

A simplified Flask app setup might look like this:

```python
# Example: backend/app.py
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello, World!'
```

For production environments, Gunicorn is configured to serve the Flask application, allowing it to handle multiple requests simultaneously through worker processes.

### Database Configuration

Supabase setup involves configuring RLS policies to ensure that data access is securely managed. This example demonstrates setting up a policy:

```sql
-- Example: Setup RLS on Supabase
CREATE POLICY tenant_isolation_policy ON public.your_table_name
FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

This SQL snippet creates an RLS policy that ensures users can only access rows where their user ID matches the `user_id` column in the table.

### Queue System

Redis Queue setup involves defining tasks and workers. Hereâ€™s an example of how you might define a simple background task:

```python
# Example: backend/tasks.py
from redis import Redis
from rq import Queue

q = Queue(connection=Redis())

def background_task(arg):
    print(f"Task executed with argument {arg}")

# Enqueueing a task
job = q.enqueue(background_task, 'example')
```

This Python code snippet enqueues a background task to be processed by a worker.

### Deployment Configuration

The `render.yaml` file specifies the configuration needed for deployment on Render.com. It would detail services, databases, environment variables, etc., necessary for deploying the entire stack.

## Troubleshooting Tips

1. **Frontend Issues**: Ensure all dependencies are correctly installed via `npm` or `yarn`. Check browser console logs for errors.
2. **Backend Connectivity**: Verify that Gunicorn is correctly set up and listening on the expected port. Ensure environment variables are correctly set for database connections.
3. **Database Policies**: If experiencing issues with data access due to RLS policies on Supabase, review your policy configurations and ensure they match your application logic.
4. **Queue System Failures**: Monitor Redis Queue dashboard for failed jobs. Check logs for specific error messages that can guide troubleshooting efforts.
5. **Deployment Errors**: Consult Render.com deployment logs if there are issues during CI/CD processes. Ensure all required environment variables are correctly defined in `render.yaml`.
