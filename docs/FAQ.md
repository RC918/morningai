# MorningAI System Architecture

The MorningAI platform is designed as a multi-tenant Software as a Service (SaaS) solution, leveraging a robust and scalable architecture to support autonomous code generation, FAQ generation, documentation management, and multi-platform integration. This architecture is optimized for performance, scalability, and ease of use.

## Overview

MorningAI employs a microservices-oriented architecture, enabling efficient development, deployment, and scaling of its various components. The key elements of the system include:

- **Frontend:** Developed with React and styled using TailwindCSS for a responsive user interface. It's built and served using Vite for an optimized development experience.
- **Backend:** Utilizes Python with Flask as the web framework, running on Gunicorn with multi-worker support to handle concurrent requests efficiently.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL is used for data storage, with Supabase adding real-time capabilities and Row Level Security (RLS) for data protection.
- **Queue System:** Redis Queue (RQ) manages background tasks such as long-running processes or scheduled jobs, with worker heartbeat monitoring to ensure reliability.
- **Orchestration:** LangGraph orchestrates agent workflows, managing the interactions between different services and components.
- **AI Integration:** Incorporates OpenAI's GPT-4 for advanced content generation capabilities.
- **Deployment:** The platform is deployed on Render.com, utilizing its CI/CD features for seamless updates and maintenance.

## Code Examples

### Starting a Flask Server with Gunicorn:

```bash
gunicorn -w 4 "app:create_app()" --bind 0.0.0.0:8000
```
This command starts a Flask application using Gunicorn with 4 workers. Replace `"app:create_app()"` with the actual path to your Flask app factory function.

### Configuring RQ Workers:

```python
from rq import Worker, Queue, Connection
import redis

redis_url = "redis://localhost:6379"
conn = redis.from_url(redis_url)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    with Connection(conn):
        worker = Worker(map(Queue, ['default']))
        worker.work()
```

This script sets up an RQ worker connected to Redis at `localhost:6379` and listens on the default queue.

## Common Troubleshooting Tips

1. **Flask App Not Starting**: Ensure that Gunicorn is correctly configured with the path to your Flask app's factory function. Also, check for any syntax errors in your Flask application.
2. **Database Connectivity Issues**: Verify that your PostgreSQL credentials are correct and that Supabase RLS policies are not unintentionally blocking access.
3. **Redis Queue Worker Errors**: If RQ workers are not processing tasks as expected, ensure they are running and connected to the correct Redis instance. Check logs for any exceptions thrown during task execution.
4. **Deployment Failures**: On Render.com, ensure your build & deploy commands are correctly specified according to your project setup. Review the deploy logs for specific error messages.
