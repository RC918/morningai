# How to Ensure Test Retry Success in MorningAI

Ensuring test retry success is crucial for maintaining the reliability and stability of the MorningAI platform. This FAQ provides a comprehensive overview of strategies and practices for achieving successful retries in tests, applicable within the MorningAI development environment.

## Understanding Test Retries

Test retries are a mechanism to automatically rerun failed tests to verify if the failure was transient or consistent. In an environment like MorningAI, where multiple components and services interact, transient failures can occur due to network latency, temporary unavailability of services, or other intermittent issues.

### Configuring Test Retries

MorningAI uses a combination of testing frameworks and custom logic to implement test retries. Hereâ€™s how you can configure test retries for your service:

#### Python (PyTest)

For Python-based services, we use PyTest along with the `pytest-rerunfailures` plugin.

```bash
pip install pytest-rerunfailures
```

To configure retries, add the following command-line option either in your pytest command or in a `pytest.ini` file:

```ini
[pytest]
addopts = --reruns 3 --reruns-delay 5
```

This configuration will retry any failed test up to 3 times with a delay of 5 seconds between each retry.

#### JavaScript (Jest)

For JavaScript services, Jest supports test retries natively through its configuration.

```json
// jest.config.js
module.exports = {
  retryTimes: 3,
};
```

This tells Jest to retry any failed test up to 3 times before marking it as failed.

### Best Practices for Test Retries

1. **Isolate Flaky Tests**: If certain tests are known to be flaky, isolate them into a separate suite or mark them explicitly. This helps in identifying whether failures are due to flakiness or genuine issues.
2. **Monitor and Analyze Failures**: Keep track of retried tests and analyze their failure patterns. Continuous failures even after retries indicate a deeper issue that needs attention.
3. **Optimize Test Environment**: Ensure that the testing environment is as stable as possible. This includes having reliable network connections, sufficient resources for the services under test, and minimizing external dependencies.
4. **Use Exponential Backoff**: In scenarios where network-related issues are common, implementing exponential backoff between retries can increase the chance of success by allowing more time for transient issues to resolve.

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Tests Not Retrying**: Verify that the configuration for test retries is correctly set in your testing framework. Also, ensure that the plugin or native support is enabled and properly configured.
- **Retries Always Fail**: If retries do not seem to mitigate test failures, investigate the root cause of the failure. Persistent failures could be indicative of real defects in the codebase rather than transient issues.
- **Performance Impact**: While retries can improve stability, they also increase the total test execution time. Monitor performance and adjust retry counts and delays accordingly to find a balance between reliability and efficiency.
