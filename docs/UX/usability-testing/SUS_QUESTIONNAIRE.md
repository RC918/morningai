## Scoring Instructions (For Researcher)

### Step 1: Convert Scores

For **odd-numbered questions** (1, 3, 5, 7, 9):
- Subtract 1 from the user's score
- Example: If user selected 4, score = 4 - 1 = 3

For **even-numbered questions** (2, 4, 6, 8, 10):
- Subtract the user's score from 5
- Example: If user selected 2, score = 5 - 2 = 3

### Step 2: Sum the Converted Scores

Add up all 10 converted scores.

**Sum**: _________

### Step 3: Multiply by 2.5

Multiply the sum by 2.5 to get the final SUS score (0-100).

**SUS Score**: _________ / 100

## Example Calculation

**User Responses**:
1. Q1: 4 → 4 - 1 = 3
2. Q2: 2 → 5 - 2 = 3
3. Q3: 5 → 5 - 1 = 4
4. Q4: 1 → 5 - 1 = 4
5. Q5: 4 → 4 - 1 = 3
6. Q6: 2 → 5 - 2 = 3
7. Q7: 4 → 4 - 1 = 3
8. Q8: 1 → 5 - 1 = 4
9. Q9: 5 → 5 - 1 = 4
10. Q10: 2 → 5 - 2 = 3

**Sum**: 3 + 3 + 4 + 4 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 4 + 4 + 3 = 34

**SUS Score**: 34 × 2.5 = **85 / 100** (Grade A - Excellent)
