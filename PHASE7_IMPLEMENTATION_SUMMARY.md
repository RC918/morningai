## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

### Component Coordination
```
Ops_Agent ←→ GrowthStrategist ←→ Meta-Agent
    ↓              ↓                ↓
PM_Agent ←→ HITL_System ←→ Phase6_Components
```

### Data Flow
1. **Ops_Agent** monitors system performance and capacity
2. **GrowthStrategist** plans campaigns based on capacity constraints
3. **PM_Agent** screens Beta candidates and analyzes feedback
4. **HITL_System** handles approval requests from Meta-Agent
5. All components report to **Phase7_System** coordinator
