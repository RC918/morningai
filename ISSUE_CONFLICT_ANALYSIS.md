## Budget Alignment Check

All issues should reference the **AI-First budget model**:
- Total Budget: $88,510 (24 weeks)
- Week 1-6 Budget: $10,560-15,060
- No human engineering team (AI Agents only)
- Owner + Devin CTO + AI Agent Ecosystem

## Notes

- **AI-First Model**: All issues should assume AI Agents perform the work, not human engineers
- **Weekly Reviews**: Every Monday review with Owner
- **Success Rate Progression**: Week 1-6 (50-60%) ‚Üí Week 7-12 (60-70%) ‚Üí Week 13-18 (70-80%) ‚Üí Week 19-24 (75-85%)
- **Realistic Expectations**: 24 weeks = "Junior to Mid-level Developer" level Agent, not Devin-level
